Today’s WOD is a fun mix of strength and conditioning that’s sure to get your heart pumping and your muscles working. Let’s break it down step by step, so you know exactly what to expect and how to tackle each part safely and effectively. Ready? Let’s go!\n\n### Part 1: Push Jerk\n**On the 1:30 x 7 (2 Push Jerks each time)**\n\n**What to do:**\n- You’ll perform 2 Push Jerks every 1 minute and 30 seconds for a total of 7 sets. \n\n**How to do it:**\n1. **Start Position:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, barbell resting on your shoulders (front rack position).\n2. **Dip:** Bend your knees slightly and push your hips back. This is your dip position.\n3. **Drive:** Explode upwards by extending your hips and knees, driving the barbell overhead.\n4. **Catch:** As the barbell rises, drop under it by bending your knees and locking out your arms overhead. Your body should be in a straight line from your wrists to your ankles.\n5. **Stand Tall:** Finish by standing tall with the barbell locked out overhead.\n\n**Form Tips:**\n- Keep your core tight and your elbows high during the dip.\n- Make sure your feet are flat on the ground during the drive.\n- Avoid leaning back; keep your torso upright.\n\n**Scaling Options:**\n- If you’re new to the Push Jerk, you can scale to a **Push Press** (no dip) or use a lighter weight.\n- You can also perform the movement with dumbbells if that feels more comfortable.\n\n**Building Weight:**\n- Start at 50-55% of your 1 Rep Max (1 RM) and gradually increase to 80-90% as you feel more confident. Listen to your body!\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Conditioning\n**3 Rounds of:**\n- 7 Handstand Push-Ups\n- 7 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees\n- 50 Lateral Dumbbell Hops\n\n**Let’s break this down:**\n\n#### Handstand Push-Ups\n**How to do it:**\n1. Kick up into a handstand against a wall or use a freestanding handstand if you’re comfortable.\n2. Lower your head to the ground, keeping your elbows tucked in.\n3. Press back up to the starting position.\n\n**Scaling Options:**\n- If you can’t do Handstand Push-Ups yet, try **Pike Push-Ups** or **Shoulder Presses** with dumbbells.\n- You can also do **Box Handstand Push-Ups** by placing your feet on a box or bench.\n\n#### Lateral Dumbbell Burpees\n**How to do it:**\n1. Start standing with a dumbbell in each hand.\n2. Drop down into a burpee position (chest to the ground).\n3. Jump back up and, instead of just standing, jump laterally over the dumbbells.\n\n**Scaling Options:**\n- If you’re not comfortable with the jump, step over the dumbbells instead.\n- You can also do the burpee without the dumbbells for less intensity.\n\n#### Lateral Dumbbell Hops\n**How to do it:**\n1. Stand next to the dumbbells.\n2. Jump laterally over the dumbbells, landing softly and keeping your knees slightly bent.\n\n**Scaling Options:**\n- If jumping is too much, you can step side to side instead.\n\n---\n\n### Rounds Breakdown\nYou’ll do 3 rounds of the above, then reduce the reps to 5 Handstand Push-Ups and 5 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees, and finally 3 Handstand Push-Ups and 3 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees in the last round. \n\n### Sweat Option\nIf you want to add a little extra, consider doing **Z-Press** or **Pike Push-Ups** as a finisher. These will help build shoulder strength and stability.\n\n### Train/Compete\nThis WOD is designed to challenge you, so push yourself but also listen to your body. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection!\n\n### Final Tips\n- Stay hydrated and take breaks as needed.\n- Focus on form over speed; it’s better to do fewer reps correctly than to rush"},"combined_content":{"date":"2025-07-14","title":"CrossFit MINS Workout","workout_text":"Workout of the Day 14.07.2025 WOD\",1.
