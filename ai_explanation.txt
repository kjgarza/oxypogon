### Part A: 
**21-18-15-12-9-6-3**
- **Double Dumbbell Hang Cleans**
- **200 Meter Run**

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Double Dumbbell Hang Cleans:**
   - **Starting Position:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.
   - **Set Up:** Hinge at the hips, lowering the dumbbells to just above the knees while keeping a flat back. Your elbows should be slightly bent.
   - **Movement:** 
     - Explode upward by extending your hips and knees.
     - Pull the dumbbells up to your shoulders, rotating your wrists so they end up resting on your shoulders (front rack position).
     - Ensure your elbows are high and your core is engaged.
   - **Finish:** Stand tall with the dumbbells at shoulder height, then lower them back to the hang position for the next rep.

   **Form Tips:**
   - Keep your back straight and chest up throughout the movement.
   - Use your legs to drive the weight up, not just your arms.
   - Maintain a neutral spine and avoid rounding your back.

   **Scaling Options:**
   - Use lighter dumbbells if the prescribed weight is too heavy.
   - Perform single dumbbell hang cleans (one arm at a time) if needed.

2. **200 Meter Run:**
   - **Execution:** After completing the hang cleans, head out for a 200-meter run. Focus on maintaining a steady pace.
   - **Form Tips:** 
     - Keep your shoulders relaxed and arms at a 90-degree angle.
     - Land softly on your feet and maintain a slight forward lean.
