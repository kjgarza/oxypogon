### Part A: 15:00 x 2 Intervals
**Workout:**  
- **21-18-15-12-9-6-3**  
  - Double Dumbbell Hang Cleans  
  - 200 Meter Run  

#### Proper Form Tips for Double Dumbbell Hang Cleans:
1. **Starting Position:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.
2. **Hinge at the Hips:** Push your hips back while keeping your chest up and back straight. The dumbbells should slide down your thighs.
3. **Pull:** As you extend your hips, pull the dumbbells up by shrugging your shoulders and bending your elbows.
4. **Catch:** Drop under the dumbbells, catching them in a front rack position (elbows high) with your knees slightly bent.
5. **Stand Up:** Finish by standing tall, ensuring your core is engaged.

#### Scaling Options:
- **Weight:** Use lighter dumbbells (e.g., 17.5/12.5 kg for Train, 15/10 kg for Sweat).
- **Movement:** If the hang clean is too complex, perform a dumbbell power clean or a dumbbell front squat instead.

#### Modifications for Beginners:
- **Reps:** Reduce the number of reps (e.g., 15-12-9-6-3).
- **Movement:** Substitute with a dumbbell deadlift or kettlebell swings if the hang clean is too challenging.
- **Run:** Walk the 200 meters instead of running.

### 200 Meter Run:
- **Form Tips:** Maintain a relaxed upper body, keep your arms at a 90-degree angle, and drive your knees forward.
- **Scaling:** If running is not feasible, substitute with a 1-minute row or a 1-minute bike ride.
