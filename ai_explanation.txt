### Step-by-Step Breakdown

**Part A: Double Dumbbell Hang Cleans & 200 Meter Run**

1. **Double Dumbbell Hang Cleans:**
   - **Starting Position:**
     - Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.
     - Hinge at the hips, lowering the dumbbells to just above the knees (this is the hang position).
   - **Movement:**
     - Explode upward by extending your hips and knees.
     - Pull the dumbbells up along your body, keeping them close to your chest.
     - Rotate your elbows under the dumbbells as you catch them in a front rack position.
   - **Proper Form Tips:**
     - Keep your back straight and core engaged during the hinge.
     - Ensure your elbows are high in the catch position.
     - Avoid rounding your back; maintain a neutral spine.
   - **Scaling Options:**
     - Reduce the weight of the dumbbells.
     - Perform single dumbbell cleans (alternating arms).
     - Use a kettlebell instead of dumbbells.

2. **200 Meter Run:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Maintain a steady pace, focusing on your breathing.
     - Keep your arms bent at 90 degrees and drive them back to help propel you forward.
