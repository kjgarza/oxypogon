Today’s WOD is all about quality and endurance. We’re going to tackle six rounds of a mix of rowing or skiing, some box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to focus on form and technique while keeping a steady pace throughout the workout. This will help build your muscular endurance and improve your overall fitness. Let’s break it down step by step!</p><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Workout Components</h4><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For the **Row**: Sit on the rower with your feet secured. Start with your knees bent and arms extended. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body. Reverse the motion smoothly.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For the **Ski Erg**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grasp the handles. Start with your arms overhead, then pull down while bending your knees slightly, engaging your core. Use your legs to drive the movement, similar to a skiing motion.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For rowing, focus on a strong leg drive and smooth recovery.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For skiing, maintain a fluid motion, using your arms and legs in sync.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If you’re new to rowing, consider reducing the time to 2:00 or using a lower resistance.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For the Ski Erg, you can also reduce the time or switch to a different cardio machine if needed.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart. Step up onto the box with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body up. Bring the other foot up to meet the first on the box, then step back down one foot at a time.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your chest up and engage your core as you step up.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Make sure your entire foot is on the box to avoid slipping.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on form.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Hold the kettlebell with both hands between your legs. Hinge at the hips and lower your body, keeping your back straight. Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up to your chin, elbows high.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep the kettlebell close to your body throughout the movement.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Engage your glutes and hamstrings as you lift.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If kettlebells are unavailable, you can substitute with dumbbells or perform a bodyweight squat.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">4. Ring Rows (10 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Set the rings to a height that allows you to lean back with arms extended. Grab the rings with an overhand grip, walk your feet forward to create tension. Pull your chest towards the rings, keeping your body straight, then lower back down.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Engage your lats and core as you pull.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Adjust the height of the rings to make it easier or harder.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If rings are not available, you can use a barbell for inverted rows or perform bent-over rows with dumbbells.</li><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Loading and Rep-Modification Options</h4><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Sweat:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: 2:00, Box Step-Ups: 16”/8”, Kettlebell: 16/8, Ring Rows: 8 reps</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Train:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: 3:00, Box Step-Ups: 20”, Kettlebell: 20/12, Ring Rows: 10 reps</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Compete:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: 3:00, Box Step-Ups: 24”/16”, Kettlebell: 24/16, Ring Rows: 12 reps</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Strategy Advice</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout each round.
