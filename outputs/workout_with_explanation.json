Todayâ€™s WOD is structured into two main segments: a strength portion focusing on the Bench Press and a conditioning piece that will really get your heart pumping. The goal here is to build upper body strength and endurance while also challenging your core and grip with the Farmers Carry. Letâ€™s break it down step by step!\n\n---\n\n## Strength Segment\n\n### Bench Press\n\n**Overview**: The Bench Press is a fantastic compound movement that targets your chest, shoulders, and triceps. Weâ€™ll be working in a descending rep scheme, which allows you to focus on building strength while gradually increasing the load.\n\n#### Technique Steps:\n1. **Setup**: Lie flat on the bench with your feet firmly planted on the ground. Your eyes should be directly under the bar.\n2. **Grip**: Grab the bar with a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width. Your wrists should be straight and aligned with your elbows.\n3. **Unrack**: Take a deep breath, engage your core, and lift the bar off the rack, holding it above your chest with arms fully extended.\n4. **Lowering the Bar**: Slowly lower the bar to your chest, keeping your elbows at about a 45-degree angle from your body.\n5. **Pressing Up**: Push the bar back up explosively while maintaining control, fully extending your arms at the top.\n\n#### Form Tips:\n- Keep your shoulder blades retracted and pressed into the bench.\n- Avoid lifting your feet off the ground; this helps maintain stability.\n- Focus on a smooth, controlled motion rather than rushing through the reps.\n\n#### Scaling/Modifications:\n- If youâ€™re new to the Bench Press, consider using a lighter weight or performing the movement with dumbbells.\n- You can also use a spotter or the safety bars for added security.\n\n#### Loading:\n- **Sweat**: Start at 40-50% of your 1RM and build to around 85-90%.\n- **Train**: Aim for a moderate weight that challenges you but allows for good form.\n- **Compete**: Push towards your max effort while maintaining technique.\n\n---\n\n## Conditioning Segment [For Time]\n\n### 80 Push-Ups\n\n**Overview**: Push-Ups are a classic bodyweight exercise that builds upper body strength and endurance. Weâ€™ll be doing a total of 80 reps, so pace yourself!\n\n#### Technique Steps:\n1. **Starting Position**: Begin in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n2. **Lowering**: Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the ground, keeping your elbows at a 45-degree angle.\n3. **Pressing Up**: Push through your palms to return to the starting position, keeping your body in a straight line.\n\n#### Form Tips:\n- Keep your core tight to avoid sagging hips.\n- If you struggle with full push-ups, feel free to drop to your knees.\n\n#### Scaling/Modifications:\n- Perform push-ups on your knees or elevate your hands on a bench to make it easier.\n- Reduce the total number of reps if needed.\n\n---\n\n### 400 Meter Double KB Farmers Carry\n\n**Overview**: This movement challenges your grip strength and core stability while also providing a great cardiovascular workout.\n\n#### Technique Steps:\n1. **Setup**: Stand tall with a kettlebell in each hand, arms at your sides.\n2. **Walking**: Engage your core and walk forward, keeping your shoulders back and chest up.\n3. **Maintain Control**: Focus on keeping the kettlebells stable and your posture upright.\n\n#### Form Tips:\n- Avoid leaning forward; keep your head up and eyes looking straight ahead.\n- Take shorter, controlled steps to maintain balance.\n\n#### Scaling/Modifications:\n- Use lighter kettlebells if needed, or reduce the distance to 200 meters.\n- You can also perform a single-arm carry if youâ€™re still building grip strength.\n\n---\n\n### 60 Push Press\n\n**Overview**: The Push Press is a dynamic movement that combines strength and power, targeting the shoulders and triceps.\n\n#### Technique Steps:\n1. **Setup**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell or dumbbells at shoulder height.\n2. **Dip**: Bend your knees slightly and lower your body into a quarter squat.\n3. **Drive**: Explosively extend your legs and press the weight overhead, locking out your arms at the top.\n4. **Lowering**: Bring the weight back down to shoulder height in a controlled manner.\n\n#### Form Tips:\n- Keep your core engaged throughout the movement.\n- Avoid overextending your back; maintain a neutral spine.\n\n#### Scaling/Modifications:\n- Use lighter weights or perform the movement seated if you have shoulder issues.\n- You can also substitute with a strict press if youâ€™re still mastering the dip drive.\n\n---\n\n### 400 Meter Double KB Farmers Carry (Repeat)\n\nJust like before, youâ€™ll finish with another round of the Farmers Carry to really challenge your endurance!\n\n---\n\n## Loading Options:\n\n- **Sweat**: 30/20 kg for KBs; 16/8 kg for Push Press.\n- **Train**: 40/27.5 kg for KBs; 20/12 kg for Push Press.\n- **Compete**: 50/35 kg for KBs; 24/16 kg for Push Press.\n\n### Strategy Advice:\n- For the Push-Ups, break them into manageable sets to avoid burnout.\n- During the Farmers Carry, focus on maintaining a steady pace rather than sprinting.\n- For the Push Press, aim for consistent breathing and rhythm to keep your energy up.\n\n---\n\nAlright, team!
