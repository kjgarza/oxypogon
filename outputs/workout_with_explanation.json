Today we’ve got a fantastic WOD lined up that’s going to challenge your strength and conditioning. We’ll kick things off with a strength segment focusing on the **Power Snatch**, where we’ll work on technique and build up to heavier weights. Then, we’ll dive into a classic benchmark workout called **\"ISABEL,\"** which is all about speed and efficiency with snatches. Finally, we’ll finish strong with a giant set of accessory movements to round out our session.

Today we’ve got a fantastic WOD lined up that’s going to challenge your strength and conditioning. We’ll kick things off with a strength segment focusing on the **Power Snatch**, where we’ll work on technique and build up to heavier weights. Then, we’ll dive into a classic benchmark workout called **\"ISABEL,\"** which is all about speed and efficiency with snatches. Finally, we’ll finish strong with a giant set of accessory movements to round out our session. Let’s break it down step by step!\n\n## Strength Segment: Power Snatch\n1. **Power Snatch (On the 1:30 x 7)**\n   - **Technique Steps:**\n     - Start with the barbell on the ground. Stand with your feet hip-width apart and grip the bar just outside your knees.\n     - Set your back by hinging at the hips and lowering your torso while keeping your chest up.\n     - Pull the bar off the ground, extending your hips and knees simultaneously.\n     - As the bar passes your knees, explosively extend your hips and shrug your shoulders.\n     - Pull yourself under the bar, catching it overhead in a partial squat position.\n     - Stand tall to finish the lift, then lower the bar back to the ground.\n   - **Form Tips:**\n     - Keep the bar close to your body throughout the lift.\n     - Focus on driving through your heels and using your legs to generate power.\n     - Maintain a strong core to stabilize the weight overhead.\n   - **Scaling/Modifications:**\n     - If you’re new to this movement, start with a PVC pipe or a lighter barbell to focus on form.\n     - You can also practice the movement with a Hang Power Snatch if the full lift feels too challenging.\n   - **Loading:**\n     - Start at 50% of your one-rep max (1RM) and aim to build up to 80-85% over the seven sets.
