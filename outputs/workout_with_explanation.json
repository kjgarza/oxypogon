Today’s WOD is structured to build strength and endurance while also incorporating some cardio. We’ll kick things off with a strength segment focusing on Back Rack Lunges, where you’ll have the opportunity to build in weight. Then, we’ll dive into a conditioning piece that combines running with double dumbbell lunges, followed by a finisher to really burn out those muscles. Let’s break it down step by step!\n\n## Strength Segment\n\n### Back Rack Lunges\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    1. Start by setting the barbell on your upper back, ensuring it’s resting comfortably on your traps.\n    2. Stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart and engage your core.\n    3. Step back with one leg, lowering your back knee towards the ground while keeping your front knee over your ankle.\n    4. Push through your front heel to return to the starting position.\n    5. Alternate legs for a total of 10 lunges (5 per leg).\n  \n- **Form Tips:**\n    - Keep your chest up and your core tight throughout the movement.\n    - Ensure your front knee doesn’t extend past your toes to protect your joints.\n    - Maintain a stable stance; your back knee should aim to touch the ground lightly.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n    - If you’re new to this movement, you can perform the lunges without weight or use a lighter barbell.\n    - Alternatively, you can do forward lunges or bodyweight lunges to focus on form.\n\n- **Loading:**\n    - **Sweat:** Start with just the barbell (20kg/15kg).\n    - **Train:** Gradually build up to 50-60% of your 1RM.\n    - **Compete:** Aim for 70-80% of your 1RM, focusing on maintaining form as you increase weight.\n\n## Conditioning Segment [On the 2:00 x 7 Rounds]\n\n### 200 Meter Run\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    1. Start with a light jog to warm up your muscles.\n    2. As you begin your run, focus on maintaining a steady pace.\n    3. Keep your arms bent at 90 degrees and drive them back and forth to help propel your body forward.\n    4. Maintain a relaxed posture, with your head up and eyes forward.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n    - Land softly on your feet to reduce impact on your joints.\n    - Keep your breathing steady and rhythmic throughout the run.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n    - If running isn’t an option, you can substitute with a 250-meter row or a 1-minute bike.\n\n### 16 Alternating Double Dumbbell Lunges\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    1. Hold a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.\n    2. Step back into a lunge with one leg, lowering your back knee toward the ground.\n    3. Push through your front heel to return to standing, then switch legs.\n    4. Alternate legs for a total of 16 lunges.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n    - Keep your torso upright and your core engaged.\n    - Ensure your front knee stays aligned over your ankle.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n    - Use lighter dumbbells or perform bodyweight lunges if needed.\n    - If you find the alternating too challenging, you can do all lunges on one leg before switching.\n\n### Loading Options:\n- **Sweat:** 15/10 kg dumbbells; consider a hill run for added challenge.\n- **Train:** 17.5/12.5 kg dumbbells.\n- **Compete:** 22.5/15 kg dumbbells.\n\n### Strategy Advice:\n- Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the run and lunges. It’s better to break up the lunges into smaller sets if you start to feel fatigued, especially since you have 7 rounds to complete!\n\n## Finisher\n\n### 3 Sets of:\n\n#### 15 Banded Pull Aparts\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    1. Stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a resistance band with both hands in front of you at shoulder height.\n    2. Keeping your arms straight, pull the band apart by moving your hands out to the sides.\n    3. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the end of the movement before returning to the starting position.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n    - Keep your core engaged and avoid arching your back.\n    - Focus on using your upper back muscles to pull the band apart.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n    - Use a lighter resistance band or perform the movement without a band if necessary.\n\n#### 45 Seconds Wall Sit (weighted if possible)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    1. Find a wall and lean against it with your back.\n    2. Slide down until your thighs are parallel to the ground, as if sitting in an invisible chair.\n    3. Keep your feet flat on the ground and your knees directly above your ankles.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n    - Maintain a straight back against the wall and keep your core tight.\n    - If using weight, hold it close to your chest or rest it on your thighs.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n    - If you’re unable to hold a wall sit, you can perform a seated hold on the ground or reduce the time to 30 seconds.\n\n### Summary\nToday’s WOD is designed to challenge your strength and endurance while keeping things fun!
