Today’s WOD is a fantastic mix of strength and conditioning that’s going to challenge your upper body strength and endurance while also getting your heart rate up. We’ll start with a strength segment focusing on the Bench Press and Bent Over Y Raises, and then we’ll dive into a conditioning piece that combines Push-ups, Double DB Renegade Rows, and Double Unders. The goal here is to build strength while also working on your muscular endurance and cardiovascular fitness.

Today’s WOD is a fantastic mix of strength and conditioning that’s going to challenge your upper body strength and endurance while also getting your heart rate up. We’ll start with a strength segment focusing on the Bench Press and Bent Over Y Raises, and then we’ll dive into a conditioning piece that combines Push-ups, Double DB Renegade Rows, and Double Unders.
