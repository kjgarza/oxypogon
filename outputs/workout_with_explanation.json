Today’s WOD is going to be a fun mix of strength and conditioning, so let’s break it down step by step. Grab your gear, and let’s get to it!\n\n### Part 1: Push Jerks\n\n**What to Do:**\n- You’ll be doing **7 sets** of **2 Push Jerks** every 1:30. So, you’ll have 90 seconds to complete your two reps and then rest until the next round starts.\n\n**How to Perform a Push Jerk:**\n1. **Start Position:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, barbell resting on your shoulders (front rack position).\n2. **Dip:** Bend your knees slightly and push your hips back. This is your dip position.\n3. **Drive:** Explode upward by extending your knees and hips while simultaneously pressing the bar overhead.\n4. **Catch:** As the bar moves up, drop under it by bending your knees and locking your arms out overhead. Your body should be in a strong, stable position with your feet under your hips.\n5. **Finish:** Stand tall with the bar locked out overhead, and then lower it back to the starting position.\n\n**Form Tips:**\n- Keep your core tight throughout the movement.\n- Make sure your elbows are slightly in front of the bar during the dip.\n- Your feet should stay flat on the ground during the dip and drive.\n\n**Scaling Options:**\n- If you’re new to the Push Jerk, you can scale down to a **Push Press** (no dip) or use a lighter weight.\n- If you don’t have access to a barbell, you can use dumbbells or kettlebells.\n\n**Building Weight:**\n- Start at about **50-55%** of your one-rep max (1 RM) for the first set and gradually increase to **80-90%** by the last set. Listen to your body and adjust as needed!\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Conditioning\n\nNow, let’s get into the conditioning part of the WOD. This is where we’ll really get that heart rate up!\n\n**3 Rounds of:**\n1. **7 Handstand Push-Ups**\n2. **7 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees**\n3. **50 Lateral Dumbbell Hops**\n\n#### Handstand Push-Ups\n- **How to Do It:** Kick up into a handstand against a wall or do them freestanding if you’re comfortable. Lower your head to the ground and push back up.\n- **Scaling:** If you’re not quite there yet, try **pike push-ups** or **elevated push-ups** with your feet on a box or bench.\n\n#### Lateral Dumbbell Burpees\n- **How to Do It:** Drop down into a burpee, chest to the ground, then jump up and laterally hop over the dumbbell.\n- **Scaling:** If the burpee is too challenging, you can step back instead of jumping or do a **dumbbell step-over** instead of a hop.\n\n#### Lateral Dumbbell Hops\n- **How to Do It:** Stand next to your dumbbell and hop laterally over it, landing softly and maintaining balance.\n- **Scaling:** If jumping is tough, you can step side to side instead.\n\n**Repeat this sequence for 3 rounds.**\n\n---\n\n### Then, we’ll do a little extra work:\n\n**3 Rounds of:**\n1. **5 Handstand Push-Ups**\n2. **5 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees**\n3. **50 Lateral Dumbbell Hops**\n\n**And finally:**\n**3 Rounds of:**\n1. **3 Handstand Push-Ups**\n2. **3 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees**\n3. **50 Lateral Dumbbell Hops**\n\n### Finisher: Sweat\n\nFor a little extra burn, you can finish off with a **Z-Press** or **Pike Push-Up**. This is a great way to work on shoulder stability and strength.\n\n**Z-Press:** Sit on the ground with your legs straight out in front of you and press the dumbbells overhead.\n**Pike Push-Up:** Get into a downward dog position and lower your head towards the ground, then push back up.\n\n### Wrap-Up\n\nAnd there you have it! This WOD is a fantastic way to build strength and endurance."},"combined_content":{"date":"2025-07-14","title":"CrossFit MINS Workout","workout_text":"Workout of the Day 14.07.2025 WOD\",1.
