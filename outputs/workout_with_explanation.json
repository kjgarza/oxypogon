Today’s WOD is designed to be a quality-focused workout that emphasizes endurance, strength, and technique. We’ll be going through six rounds of rowing or skiing, followed by some box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement while keeping a steady pace. Let’s break it down step by step!\n\n## Workout Components\n\n### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    - For the Row: Sit on the rower with your feet secured. Start with your knees bent and your shins vertical.

Grip the handles with both hands, keeping your arms straight.\n    - Engage your core and pull the handles down towards your hips, using your legs and arms in a coordinated motion.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n    - Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement.\n    - Avoid overextending your back; maintain a neutral spine.\n    - Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n    - If you’re new to rowing, consider reducing the time to 2:00 or using a lighter resistance on the Ski Erg.\n    - Focus on technique rather than speed.\n\n### 2.
