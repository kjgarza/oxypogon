Ring Rows (10 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back with your arms extended.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Grab the rings with an overhand grip and walk your feet forward until your body is at an angle.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Pull your chest to the rings, keeping your body straight and core engaged, then lower back down.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Avoid sagging your hips; keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If rings are too challenging, you can use a barbell set at waist height for inverted rows.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Adjust the angle of your body to make it easier or harder.</li><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Loading and Rep-Modification Options</h4><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Sweat:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lighter kettlebell (16/8 kg) and focus on form over speed.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Train:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a moderate kettlebell (20/12 kg) and aim for a steady pace throughout the rounds.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Compete:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a heavier kettlebell (24/16 kg) and push your limits while maintaining quality.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Strategy Advice</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Pacing:** Start each round at a comfortable pace, especially on the row or ski erg.
