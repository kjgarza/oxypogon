Today’s WOD is a fantastic blend of strength and conditioning that will really challenge your power and endurance. We’ll kick things off with an EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute) segment focusing on Power Cleans, where we’ll work on our technique and gradually increase the load. After that, we’ll dive into a conditioning piece that combines core work with some solid deadlifts and kettlebell swings.

We’ll kick things off with an EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute) segment focusing on Power Cleans, where we’ll work on our technique and gradually increase the load. After that, we’ll dive into a conditioning piece that combines core work with some solid deadlifts and kettlebell swings. This workout is designed to build strength, improve your metabolic conditioning, and enhance your overall fitness.\n\n---\n\n## Strength Segment\n\n### Power Clean (Barbell):\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    1. **Setup**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart, barbell over the midfoot.

Stand with your feet hip-width apart, barbell over the midfoot.\n    2. Bend at the hips and knees to grip the bar, keeping your back flat and chest up.\n    3.
