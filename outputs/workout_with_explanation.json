Today‚Äôs WOD is a great mix of cardio and strength, and I‚Äôm here to break it down for you step by step. Let‚Äôs dive in!\n\n### **WOD Overview:**\n**Date:** 16.07.2025  \n**Workout Type:** Conditioning  \n**Format:** 2 Rounds For Time  \n- **1 Mile Run**  \n- **60/45 Calories Row**  \n- **50/35 Calories Bike**  \n- *Switch between Row and Bike*  \n\n**Finisher:**  \n**3 Giant Sets:**  \n- 10/10 Half Kneeling Pallof Presses  \n- 10 Double Dumbbell French Press  \n- 10 Double Dumbbell Chest Flys  \n- *Rest as Needed between sets*  \n\n---\n\n### **Part 1: Conditioning**\n\n#### **1. Mile Run**\n**Instructions:**\n1. **Warm-Up:** Start with a light jog or dynamic stretches to get your muscles ready.\n2. **Form Tips:** Keep your head up, shoulders relaxed, and arms at a 90-degree angle. Your feet should land softly under your hips.\n3. **Pacing:** Find a pace that you can maintain for the full mile. It‚Äôs okay to start slower and pick up speed as you go.\n4. **Scaling Options:** If a mile run feels too daunting, you can scale it down to a 800m run or even a brisk walk.\n\n#### **2. Rowing (60/45 Calories)**\n**Instructions:**\n1. **Setup:** Adjust the foot straps so your feet are secure but not too tight.\n2. **Starting Position:** Sit tall with your back straight, knees bent, and grab the handle with both hands.\n3. **The Stroke:**\n   - **Drive:** Push through your heels, extend your legs, and pull the handle towards your chest while leaning back slightly.\n   - **Recovery:** Extend your arms first, then lean forward from your hips, and finally bend your knees to return to the starting position.\n4. **Form Tips:** Keep your core engaged and avoid hunching over. Your strokes should be powerful and smooth.\n5. **Scaling Options:** If rowing is new to you, aim for 30 calories or switch to a stationary bike.\n\n#### **3. Biking (50/35 Calories)**\n**Instructions:**\n1. **Setup:** Adjust the seat height so that your legs have a slight bend at the bottom of the pedal stroke.\n2. **Starting Position:** Sit comfortably on the bike with your hands gripping the handlebars.\n3. **Pedaling:** Keep a steady pace, using your legs to push down and pull up on the pedals.\n4. **Form Tips:** Maintain a straight back and avoid leaning too far forward. Keep your core tight.\n5. **Scaling Options:** If biking feels too intense, reduce the calories to 25 or switch to a light jog.\n\n### **Part 2: Finisher**\n\n#### **Giant Set Instructions:**\nYou‚Äôll perform three exercises back-to-back, resting as needed between sets. \n\n**1. Half Kneeling Pallof Presses (10/10)**\n- **Setup:** Kneel on one knee with the opposite foot in front. Hold a resistance band or a dumbbell at your chest.\n- **Press:** Extend your arms straight out in front of you, engaging your core to resist rotation.\n- **Return:** Bring your arms back to your chest.\n- **Tip:** Keep your hips square and avoid leaning back.\n\n**2. Double Dumbbell French Press (10 reps)**\n- **Setup:** Stand or sit with a dumbbell in each hand, arms extended overhead.\n- **Lower:** Bend your elbows to lower the dumbbells behind your head.\n- **Press:** Extend your arms back to the starting position.\n- **Tip:** Keep your elbows close to your head to isolate the triceps.\n\n**3. Double Dumbbell Chest Flys (10 reps)**\n- **Setup:** Lie on a bench or the floor with a dumbbell in each hand, arms extended above your chest.\n- **Lower:** Slowly open your arms wide, keeping a slight bend in your elbows.\n- **Return:** Bring the dumbbells back together over your chest.\n- **Tip:** Control the movement to avoid straining your shoulders.\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\nRemember, it‚Äôs all about quality over quantity. Focus on your form, listen to your body, and don‚Äôt hesitate to scale the workouts to fit your fitness level.
