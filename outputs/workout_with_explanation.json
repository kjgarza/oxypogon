Today’s WOD is going to be a fantastic mix of strength and conditioning. We’ll kick things off with a strength segment focusing on the **Power Clean**, where we’ll work on our technique and build up to a challenging weight. Then, we’ll dive into a conditioning piece that will test our endurance and coordination with a series of power cleans, lateral barbell burpees, and toes to bar. This workout is designed to improve your overall strength and metabolic conditioning, so let’s break it down step by step!\n\n## Strength Segment\n\n### Power Clean (Paused)\n\n**Overview**: The Power Clean is a dynamic movement that requires explosive power and good technique. We’ll be pausing at knee height to reinforce proper positioning and control.\n\n- **Technique Steps**:\n    1. Start with your feet hip-width apart, barbell over the midfoot.\n    2. Grip the bar just outside your knees, keeping your back flat and chest up.\n    3. Initiate the lift by driving through your heels, extending your hips and knees simultaneously.\n    4. As the bar passes your knees, pull yourself under the bar, catching it on your shoulders in a quarter squat.\n    5. Hold for a 3-second pause just below knee height before standing tall and resetting for the next rep.\n\n- **Form Tips**:\n    - Keep the bar close to your body throughout the lift.\n    - Focus on a strong hip extension; this is where your power comes from!\n    - Maintain a neutral spine; avoid rounding your back.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications**:\n    - If you’re new to this movement, consider using a lighter barbell or even a PVC pipe to focus on form.\n    - You can also perform the movement without the pause if you’re still mastering the clean.\n\n- **Loading**:\n    - Start at 40-50% of your 1RM and gradually build up to 75-85% by the last set.\n    - **Sweat**: 40% of 1RM\n    - **Train**: 60-70% of 1RM\n    - **Compete**: 75-85% of 1RM\n\n## Conditioning Segment [For Time]\n\n### 6-5-4-3-2-1 Ladder\n\n**Movements**:\n1. Power Clean\n2. Lateral Barbell Burpees\n3. Toes to Bar\n\n**Overview**: This part of the workout is a descending ladder format, which means you’ll do 6 reps of each movement, then 5, and so on down to 1. This format keeps the intensity high and helps with pacing.\n\n### 1. Power Clean\n\n- **Technique Steps**:\n    - Same as the strength segment, but focus on speed and efficiency.\n    - Aim to catch the bar in a stable position and stand up quickly.\n\n- **Form Tips**:\n    - Keep your elbows high and your core engaged.\n    - Use your legs to drive the bar up rather than relying solely on your arms.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications**:\n    - Use a lighter weight if needed, or perform a hang power clean if you’re still working on the full movement.\n\n### 2. Lateral Barbell Burpees\n\n- **Technique Steps**:\n    1. Start standing next to the barbell.\n    2. Drop into a squat and place your hands on the bar.\n    3. Jump your feet back into a plank position.\n    4. Perform a push-up (optional).\n    5. Jump your feet back to your hands, stand up, and jump laterally over the barbell.\n    \n- **Form Tips**:\n    - Keep your core tight to maintain stability during the plank.\n    - Land softly when jumping over the bar to avoid injury.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications**:\n    - Step back instead of jumping if you need to reduce impact.\n    - You can also perform the burpees without the push-up if you’re still building strength.\n\n### 3. Toes to Bar\n\n- **Technique Steps**:\n    1. Hang from the pull-up bar with an overhand grip.\n    2. Engage your core and pull your knees up towards your chest.\n    3. From there, extend your legs and bring your toes to the bar.\n    4. Lower back down with control.\n\n- **Form Tips**:\n    - Keep your shoulders engaged and avoid swinging.\n    - Use a kipping motion if you’re comfortable to generate momentum.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications**:\n    - If toes to bar are too challenging, you can scale to knee raises or hanging knee tucks.\n    - If hanging is difficult, perform the movement on a low bar or use a box for support.\n\n### Loading Options:\n\n- **Sweat**: 50/35 lbs for Power Cleans; 15 Knee Raises instead of Toes to Bar.\n- **Train**: 70/50 lbs for Power Cleans; 10 Toes to Bar.\n- **Compete**: 90/65 lbs for Power Cleans; standard Toes to Bar.\n\n### Strategy Advice:\n\n- For the ladder, aim to maintain a steady pace. It’s better to break up the sets early rather than going all out and burning out quickly.\n- Focus on your breathing, especially during the burpees and toes to bar, to keep your heart rate manageable.\n- Remember to hydrate and listen to your body—if you need to scale or take a break, that’s perfectly okay!\n\nAlright team, let’s get after it!
