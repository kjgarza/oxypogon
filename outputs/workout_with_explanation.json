Today’s WOD is all about quality and consistency. We’ll be going through 6 rounds of a mix of cardio, strength, and bodyweight movements. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round, focusing on controlled movements rather than rushing through. This will help build endurance, strength, and technique. Let’s break it down!</p><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Workout Components</h4><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For the Row: Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and arms extended. Drive through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest, then return to the starting position.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For the Ski Erg: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, grip the handles, and pull down with your arms while using your legs to assist. Keep your core engaged and maintain a steady rhythm.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your back straight and core tight to avoid rounding your spine.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use your legs to drive the movement; your arms should follow through.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Maintain a consistent pace; don’t go all out at the start.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If you’re new to rowing or skiing, aim for a lower intensity or shorter duration (e.g., 2:00).</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Focus on technique rather than speed; it’s okay to take breaks as needed.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">2. Box Step-ups (20 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand facing the box with your feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box. Step back down and repeat with the other leg.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Drive through your heel to activate your glutes and hamstrings.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use your arms for balance if needed.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If you have knee issues, consider stepping onto a sturdy platform or performing a seated leg lift instead.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Hold the kettlebell with both hands between your legs. Hinge at your hips to lower your body, then explosively extend your hips and pull the kettlebell up to your chin, keeping your elbows high.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your back flat and chest up during the hinge.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Focus on using your hips to generate power; your arms should be relaxed until the pull.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Control the kettlebell back down to the starting position.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If kettlebells aren’t available, you can substitute with dumbbells or perform a bodyweight squat.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">4. Ring Rows (10 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Set the rings at a height that allows you to pull your body up while keeping your feet on the ground. Grab the rings with an overhand grip, lean back, and pull your chest towards the rings, keeping your body straight.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels; avoid sagging your hips.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Control your descent to maintain tension in your muscles.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If rings are too challenging, you can use a barbell set at waist height for inverted rows.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Alternatively, perform bent-over rows with dumbbells or a barbell.</li><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Loading and Rep-Modification Options</h4><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Sweat:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Kettlebell: 16kg/8kg</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Focus on form and technique; aim for a steady pace.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Train:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Kettlebell: 20kg/12kg</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Challenge yourself but maintain quality over quantity.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Compete:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Kettlebell: 24kg/16kg</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Push your limits while ensuring you keep good form throughout.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Strategy Advice</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Pacing:** Start at a comfortable pace and focus on maintaining it throughout the rounds. It’s better to finish strong than to burn out early.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Breaks:** Don’t hesitate to take short breaks between movements if needed, especially on the kettlebell high pulls and ring rows.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Focus:** Remember, quality over quantity!
