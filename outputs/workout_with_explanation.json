We’ll start with a rowing piece to get our heart rates up, followed by an AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) that includes kettlebell swings and sit-ups. After that, we’ll finish strong with some accessory work focusing on core strength. The goal here is to build stamina and core stability while keeping the movements efficient and safe.\n\n---\n\n## Conditioning Segment\n\n### Rowing (3k/2k Row)\n\n**Technique Steps:**\n1. **Set Up**: Sit on the rower with your feet secured in the foot straps. Adjust the foot straps so they are snug but not too tight.\n2. **Grip**: Hold the handle with both hands, palms facing down, and arms extended.\n3. **The Catch**: Slide forward, bending your knees and keeping your back straight. Your shins should be vertical, and your arms should be straight.\n4. **The Drive**: Push through your heels, extend your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest. Keep your elbows close to your body.\n5. **The Finish**: At the end of the pull, your legs should be straight, and the handle should be at your chest. Reverse the motion to return to the catch position.\n\n**Form Tips:**\n- Focus on a smooth, powerful drive with your legs; your arms should only engage at the end of the pull.\n- Maintain a straight back throughout the movement to avoid strain.\n\n**Scaling/Modifications:**\n- If you're new to rowing, reduce the distance to 2.5k/1.5k or even 1k to build confidence.\n- Focus on technique rather than speed; it’s better to row slower with good form than faster with poor form.\n\n### AMRAP 12\n\n#### 12 Russian Kettlebell Swings\n\n**Technique Steps:**\n1. **Start Position**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, kettlebell on the ground in front of you.\n2. **Hinge**: Bend at the hips, keeping your back straight, and grab the kettlebell with both hands.\n3. **Swing**: Drive your hips forward, swinging the kettlebell up to shoulder height. Your arms should be relaxed, and the power should come from your hips.\n4. **Return**: Allow the kettlebell to swing back down between your legs, maintaining a strong hinge.\n\n**Form Tips:**\n- Keep your core engaged throughout the movement.\n- Avoid using your arms to lift the kettlebell; it should be a hip-driven movement.\n\n**Scaling/Modifications:**\n- Use a lighter kettlebell or perform the swings with a dumbbell if kettlebells are not available.\n- If you’re new to this movement, try performing swings to eye level instead of shoulder height.\n\n#### 15 Abmat Sit-ups\n\n**Technique Steps:**\n1. **Start Position**: Sit on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat. Place the Abmat under your lower back for support.\n2. **The Movement**: Lean back, keeping your core engaged, and then sit up by driving your hips forward and bringing your torso to your thighs.\n3. **Finish**: Touch your toes or the ground in front of you at the top of the sit-up.\n\n**Form Tips:**\n- Keep your feet together and avoid using momentum to sit up.\n- Focus on controlled movements rather than rushing through the reps.\n\n**Scaling/Modifications:**\n- If sit-ups are challenging, try performing them with your feet anchored under a barbell or use a medicine ball for support.\n- You can also perform crunches instead of full sit-ups to reduce strain.\n\n### Loading Options:\n\n- **Sweat**: 16/12 kg kettlebell, 2.5k / 1.5k Row\n- **Train**: 24/16 kg kettlebell\n- **Compete**: 32/24 kg kettlebell\n\n### Strategy Advice:\n- For the rowing, find a steady pace that you can maintain throughout the distance.
