Box Step-Ups (20 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart.

Ring Rows (10 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Set the rings at a height where you can lean back with your arms extended.

The lower the rings, the more challenging the row.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If rings are not available, you can substitute with TRX rows or bent-over dumbbell rows.</li><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Loading and Rep-Modification Options</h4><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Sweat:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: Moderate pace, aim for 60-70% effort.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Box Step-Ups: Bodyweight or light weights.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Kettlebell: 16/8 kg.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Ring Rows: Bodyweight or elevated.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Train:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: Steady pace, aim for 70-80% effort.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Box Step-Ups: Moderate weight (e.g., 10-15 lbs).</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Kettlebell: 20/12 kg.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Ring Rows: Bodyweight.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Compete:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: Push for 80-90% effort.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Box Step-Ups: Heavier weight (e.g., 20-25 lbs).</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Kettlebell: 24/16 kg.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Ring Rows: Bodyweight or add a weighted vest.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Strategy Advice</h5><br><p class=\"mb-2\">As you work through these rounds, focus on maintaining a steady pace rather than going all out.
