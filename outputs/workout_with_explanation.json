Today’s WOD is a fun mix of strength and conditioning that’s going to challenge you, but don’t worry—I’m here to guide you through it step by step. Let’s break it down!\n\n### Part 1: Push Jerks\n\n**What to Do:**\n- You’ll be doing 2 Push Jerks every 1:30 for a total of 7 rounds. \n\n**How to Perform a Push Jerk:**\n1. **Setup:** Start with your feet shoulder-width apart, barbell resting on your shoulders (front rack position). Your elbows should be slightly in front of the bar.\n2. **Dip:** Bend your knees slightly and push your hips back. This is a quick dip, not a squat!\n3. **Drive:** Explode upward by pushing through your heels and extending your hips and knees.\n4. **Catch:** As the bar rises, drop under it by bending your knees and locking your arms overhead. Your body should be in a straight line from your wrists to your heels.\n5. **Stand:** Finish by standing tall with the bar locked out overhead.\n\n**Form Tips:**\n- Keep your core tight throughout the movement.\n- Make sure your elbows are high in the front rack position.\n- Your feet should be flat on the ground during the dip and drive.\n\n**Scaling Options:**\n- If you’re new to the Push Jerk, you can scale down to a **Push Press** (no dip) or even use a lighter weight.\n- If you’re still working on your overhead strength, consider using dumbbells or kettlebells instead.\n\n**Building Weight:**\n- Start at 50-55% of your one-rep max (1 RM) and gradually increase to 80-90% as you feel comfortable. Listen to your body!\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Conditioning\n\nThis part is where the fun really kicks in! You’ll be doing a series of rounds with a mix of Handstand Push-Ups, Lateral Dumbbell Burpees, and Lateral Dumbbell Hops. \n\n**3 Rounds of:**\n- **7 Handstand Push-Ups**\n- **7 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees**\n- **50 Lateral Dumbbell Hops**\n\n**Handstand Push-Ups:**\n- Kick up into a handstand against a wall or use a box for an elevated version.\n- Lower your head to the ground and push back up, keeping your core engaged.\n\n**Scaling Options:**\n- If you can’t do Handstand Push-Ups yet, try **Pike Push-Ups** or **Regular Push-Ups** instead.\n\n**Lateral Dumbbell Burpees:**\n1. Place a dumbbell on the ground.\n2. Perform a burpee by going down to the ground, chest touching, then jump back up.\n3. Jump laterally over the dumbbell to the other side and repeat.\n\n**Scaling Options:**\n- If burpees are tough, step back instead of jumping, or do a **Dumbbell Deadlift** instead of the burpee.\n\n**Lateral Dumbbell Hops:**\n- Stand next to the dumbbell and hop laterally over it, landing softly. Keep your knees slightly bent.\n\n**Scaling Options:**\n- If hopping is too much, you can step side to side instead.\n\n---\n\n### 3 Rounds of: \n- **5 Handstand Push-Ups**\n- **5 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees**\n- **50 Lateral Dumbbell Hops**\n\nThis is a slightly reduced rep scheme, so push yourself a bit more here!\n\n---\n\n### 3 Rounds of:\n- **3 Handstand Push-Ups**\n- **3 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees**\n- **50 Lateral Dumbbell Hops**\n\nThis final round is all about finishing strong. You’ve got this!\n\n---\n\n### Sweat Option:\nIf you want to add a little extra, consider doing **Z-Press** or **Pike Push-Ups** as a finisher. These will help build shoulder strength and stability.\n\n### Train vs. Compete:\n- **Train:** Focus on form and technique, especially if you’re new to these movements.\n- **Compete:** If you’re feeling good, push for speed and intensity!\n\nRemember, the goal is to challenge yourself while maintaining good form. If you need to take a break or modify any movements, that’s"},"combined_content":{"date":"2025-07-14","title":"CrossFit MINS Workout","workout_text":"Workout of the Day 14.07.2025 WOD\",1.
