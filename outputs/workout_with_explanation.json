Today’s WOD is a fantastic blend of strength and conditioning that will really challenge your power and endurance. We’ll kick things off with a strength segment focusing on the Hang Clean and Jerk, where we’ll work on our technique and build up to a heavier weight. Then, we’ll dive into a conditioning piece that combines Hang Power Cleans and Shoulder to Overhead with some hill runs to really get that heart rate up.
