Todayâ€™s WOD is a fun mix of strength and conditioning thatâ€™s going to challenge you, but donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m here to guide you through it step by step. Letâ€™s break it down!\n\n### Part 1: Push Jerks\n\n**What to Do:**\n- Youâ€™ll be doing 2 Push Jerks every 1:30 for a total of 7 rounds. \n\n**How to Perform a Push Jerk:**\n1. **Start Position:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, barbell resting on your shoulders (front rack position).\n2. **Dip:** Bend your knees slightly and push your hips back. This is your dip.\n3. **Drive:** Explode upward by straightening your legs and driving through your heels.\n4. **Catch:** As you drive up, press the bar overhead, locking your elbows out. Make sure your head comes slightly forward to let the bar pass.\n5. **Finish:** Stand tall with the bar overhead, arms locked out, and core engaged.\n\n**Form Tips:**\n- Keep your core tight throughout the movement.\n- Your elbows should be slightly in front of the bar during the dip.\n- Make sure to land with your feet in the same position as your starting stance.\n\n**Scaling Options:**\n- If youâ€™re new to the Push Jerk, you can start with a lighter weight or even a PVC pipe to practice the movement.\n- If youâ€™re not comfortable with the overhead position, you can substitute with a Push Press (no dip) or even a Dumbbell Shoulder Press.\n\n**Building Weight:**\n- Start at 50-55% of your 1 Rep Max (1 RM) and gradually increase to 80-90% as you feel comfortable. Listen to your body!\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Conditioning\n\nNow, letâ€™s get into the conditioning part, which is a bit of a grind but super rewarding!\n\n**3 Rounds of:**\n- **7 Handstand Push-Ups**\n- **7 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees**\n- **50 Lateral Dumbbell Hops**\n\n#### Handstand Push-Ups\n**How to Perform:**\n1. Kick up into a handstand against a wall or do a freestanding handstand if youâ€™re feeling confident.\n2. Lower your head to the ground, keeping your elbows tucked in.\n3. Press back up to the starting position.\n\n**Scaling Options:**\n- If you canâ€™t do Handstand Push-Ups yet, try pike push-ups or regular push-ups with your feet elevated on a box or bench.\n\n#### Lateral Dumbbell Burpees\n**How to Perform:**\n1. Start standing with a dumbbell in each hand.\n2. Drop down into a burpee: chest to the ground, then jump back up.\n3. Jump laterally over the dumbbells to complete one rep.\n\n**Scaling Options:**\n- If the burpee is too challenging, step back instead of jumping, or just do a squat thrust without the push-up.\n\n#### Lateral Dumbbell Hops\n**How to Perform:**\n1. Stand next to the dumbbells.\n2. Jump laterally over the dumbbells, landing softly and maintaining balance.\n\n**Scaling Options:**\n- If jumping is tough, you can step side to side instead of jumping.\n\n---\n\n### Rounds Breakdown\nYouâ€™ll do 3 rounds of 7 Handstand Push-Ups, 7 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees, and 50 Lateral Dumbbell Hops. Then, youâ€™ll drop the reps to 5 and then to 3 for the next two sets. This is a great way to keep the intensity high while allowing for some recovery as the reps decrease.\n\n---\n\n### Sweat Option\nIf youâ€™re looking for a lighter workout today, consider doing Z-Press or Pike Push-Ups instead of Handstand Push-Ups. This will still give you a great shoulder workout without the intensity of going upside down.\n\n### Train/Compete\nThis section is for those who want to push their limits. If youâ€™re feeling good, go for it! Just remember to maintain good form and listen to your body.\n\n---\n\nAnd there you have it! A solid WOD thatâ€™s going to test your strength and conditioning. Remember to hydrate, warm up properly, and most importantly, have fun! Youâ€™ve got this! ðŸ’ª"},"combined_content":{"date":"2025-07-14","title":"CrossFit MINS Workout","workout_text":"Workout of the Day 14.07.2025 WOD\",1.
