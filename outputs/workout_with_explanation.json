Today’s WOD is all about quality and consistency. We’re diving into a 6-round workout that combines some cardio, strength, and bodyweight movements. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while focusing on your breathing and pacing. We want to build endurance and strength without sacrificing technique. Let’s break it down!\n\n---\n\n## Workout Components\n\n### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    - **Rowing:** Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and your back straight. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.\n    - **Ski Erg:** Stand tall, grab the handles, and keep your core engaged. Pull down with your arms while driving your knees slightly forward, mimicking a skiing motion.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n    - Keep your back straight and avoid hunching over.\n    - Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.\n    - Maintain a steady rhythm; don’t rush!\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n    - If you’re new to rowing, aim for a lower intensity or shorter duration (e.g., 2:00).\n    - For the Ski Erg, reduce the resistance if it feels too challenging.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Box Step-ups (20 reps)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    - Stand facing the box with your feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.\n    - Bring your other foot up to meet the first, then step back down one foot at a time.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n    - Keep your chest up and engage your core.\n    - Make sure your entire foot is on the box to avoid slipping.\n    - Alternate legs for each rep to ensure balanced work.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.\n    - If you have knee issues, consider doing step-ups without weights or using a sturdy platform.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Place the kettlebell between your feet.\n    - Hinge at the hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands.

Ring Rows (10 reps)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    - Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them while standing. Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight.\n    - Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together, then lower back down.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.\n    - Engage your core to avoid sagging hips.\n    - Focus on a controlled movement rather than rushing through reps.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n    - Adjust the height of the rings to make it easier or harder.\n    - If rings are too challenging, you can substitute with inverted rows using a barbell or a TRX.\n\n---\n\n## Loading and Rep-Modification Options\n\n- **Sweat:** \n    - Row/Ski: 2:00\n    - Box Step-ups: 16/8 (use bodyweight)\n    - Kettlebell: 16/8 kg\n    - Ring Rows: 8 reps\n\n- **Train:** \n    - Row/Ski: 3:00\n    - Box Step-ups: 20 reps (bodyweight or light weight)\n    - Kettlebell: 20/12 kg\n    - Ring Rows: 10 reps\n\n- **Compete:** \n    - Row/Ski: 3:00\n    - Box Step-ups: 20 reps (weighted)\n    - Kettlebell: 24/16 kg\n    - Ring Rows: 10 reps\n\n### Strategy Advice\n\n- **Pacing:** Start at a steady pace that you can maintain throughout all 6 rounds. It’s better to go slower and maintain form than to rush and risk injury.\n- **Breathing:** Focus on your breathing, especially during the rowing and kettlebell movements. Inhale on the way down and exhale on the exertion.\n- **Rest:** Take short breaks as needed, but try to keep them under 30 seconds to maintain your heart rate and momentum.\n\n---\n\nAlright team, let’s get after it!
