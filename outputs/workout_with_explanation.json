Today’s WOD is designed to build endurance and strength while focusing on quality movement. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of a mix of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement, ensuring we’re not just rushing through but really focusing on quality reps. Let’s break it down!</p><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Workout Components</h4><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Rowing:** Sit on the rower with your feet secured. Start with your knees bent and arms extended. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Ski Erg:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grasp the handles. Use your legs to initiate the pull, then engage your core and pull the handles down towards your hips, keeping your elbows straight.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For rowing, focus on a smooth, powerful leg drive followed by a strong pull with your arms.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For the Ski Erg, think about using your whole body, not just your arms.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If you’re new to rowing, consider reducing the time to 2:00 or rowing at a slower pace.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For the Ski Erg, you can also reduce the resistance or focus on a slower, controlled pace.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">2. Box Step-ups (20 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand in front of the box with feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box. Bring the other foot up to meet it, then step back down one foot at a time.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your chest up and core tight as you step up.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Make sure your entire foot is on the box to avoid slipping.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on balance and form.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Hold the kettlebell with both hands in front of you. Hinge at the hips and lower the kettlebell between your legs. Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up to your chin with elbows high.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your back flat and chest up during the hinge.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use your legs to initiate the movement, not just your arms.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If kettlebells are unavailable, you can substitute with dumbbells or perform a bodyweight squat.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">4. Ring Rows (10 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back with arms extended. Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight. Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together, then lower back down.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Engage your core and avoid letting your hips sag.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows using a barbell or a TRX.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Adjust the height of the rings to make it easier or harder based on your strength level.</li><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Loading and Rep-Modification Options</h4><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Sweat:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: 2:00, Box Step-ups: 16/8, Kettlebell: 12kg/6kg, Ring Rows: 8 reps</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Focus on maintaining a steady pace and good form.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Train:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: 3:00, Box Step-ups: 20/12, Kettlebell: 16kg/8kg, Ring Rows: 10 reps</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Aim for a moderate intensity, breaking up sets if needed.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Compete:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: 3:00, Box Step-ups: 24/16, Kettlebell: 24kg/16kg, Ring Rows: 12 reps</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Push your limits but prioritize form over speed.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Strategy Advice</h5><br><p class=\"mb-2\">As you go through this WOD, remember that quality over quantity is key. Take your time on each movement, especially on the rowing and kettlebell pulls, to ensure you’re using the right muscles and not just rushing through. Break up the box step-ups and ring rows if you start to feel fatigued, and don’t hesitate to scale if needed.
