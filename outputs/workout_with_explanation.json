Today’s WOD is all about quality movement and building endurance. We’re going to tackle six rounds of a mix of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement while focusing on a steady pace. This workout is designed to challenge your cardiovascular fitness, lower body strength, and upper body pulling power. Let’s break it down!\n\n## Workout Components\n\n### 1.
