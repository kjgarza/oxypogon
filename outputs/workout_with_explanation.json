Todayâ€™s WOD is structured as a series of 10 intervals, alternating between even and odd rounds. The goal here is to build strength and endurance while keeping your heart rate up. Weâ€™ll be tackling some challenging movements, but donâ€™t worryâ€”weâ€™ll break it down step by step. Remember, the focus is on quality movement and pushing your limits safely!</p><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Even Intervals</h4><li class=\"ml-4\">**3 Rope Climbs**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Start by sitting on the ground with the rope above you.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use your legs to push off the ground and pull with your arms, wrapping your feet around the rope for support.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Alternate between pulling with your arms and pushing with your legs to climb efficiently.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">At the top, control your descent back down.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your core engaged to maintain stability.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use your legs as much as possible to reduce the load on your arms.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If youâ€™re new to rope climbs, try 3 negative rope climbs (slowly lowering yourself down).</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Alternatively, use a low bar for pull-ups or a rope pull from a seated position.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**20 Lateral Jumps over Kettlebell (L+R = 1)**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart next to the kettlebell.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Bend your knees slightly and jump laterally over the kettlebell, landing softly on the other side.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Immediately jump back to the starting position.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your chest up and land softly to absorb the impact.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use your arms to help with momentum and balance.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Reduce the number of

class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, holding the kettlebell with both hands.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Hinge at your hips, allowing the kettlebell to swing back between your legs.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Drive your hips forward to swing the kettlebell up to shoulder height, keeping your arms straight.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Focus on using your hips, not your arms, to generate power.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your back flat and core engaged throughout the movement.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lighter kettlebell or perform swings with a dumbbell.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If youâ€™re still mastering the swing, try doing Russian swings (kettlebell swings to waist height).</li><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Odd Intervals</h4><li class=\"ml-4\">**15 Burpees**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Start standing tall, then drop into a squat and place your hands on the ground.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Jump your feet back into a plank position, perform a push-up, and jump your feet back to your hands.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Explode upwards into a jump, reaching your arms overhead.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your core tight during the plank to prevent sagging hips.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Land softly on your feet to minimize impact.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Step back instead of jumping if youâ€™re still working on your burpee.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Perform a burpee without the push-up for a modified version.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**20 Lateral Jumps over D-Ball (L+R = 1)**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand next to the D-Ball with feet shoulder-width apart.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Bend your knees slightly and jump laterally over the D-Ball, landing softly on the other side.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Jump back to the starting position.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your chest up and land softly to absorb the impact.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use your arms for balance and momentum.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Reduce the number of jumps if necessary.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Step over the D-Ball instead of jumping if you need to.</li><br><li

class=\"ml-4\">Squat down slightly, then lift the ball overhead and slam it down to the ground with force.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Catch the ball on the bounce and repeat.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Engage your core and use your legs to generate power for the slam.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lighter slam ball or perform the movement with a medicine ball if needed.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If youâ€™re new to this, focus
