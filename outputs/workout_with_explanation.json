Todayâ€™s WOD is a fantastic mix of strength and conditioning that will really challenge your upper body and lower body endurance. Weâ€™ll kick things off with a **Tempo Bench Press** to focus on strength and control, followed by a conditioning piece that includes some fun movements like **Double Dumbbell Box Step Ups** and **Dumbbell Push-ups**. The goal here is to build strength while also pushing your cardiovascular limits. Letâ€™s break it down step by step!</p><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Strength Segment</h4><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">1. **Tempo Bench Press**</h5><li class=\"ml-4\">**Overview:** The Tempo Bench Press is all about control and time under tension. By slowing down the eccentric (lowering) phase, weâ€™re working on strength and stability in the chest, shoulders, and triceps. This is crucial for building a solid foundation for heavier lifts in the future.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">**Setup:** Lie flat on a bench with your feet firmly planted on the ground.

Todayâ€™s WOD is a fantastic mix of strength and conditioning that will really challenge your upper body and lower body endurance. Weâ€™ll kick things off with a **Tempo Bench Press** to focus on strength and control, followed by a conditioning piece that includes some fun movements like **Double Dumbbell Box Step Ups** and **Dumbbell Push-ups**. The goal here is to build strength while also pushing your cardiovascular limits. Letâ€™s break it down step by step!\n\n## Strength Segment\n### 1. **Tempo Bench Press**\n- **Overview:** The Tempo Bench Press is all about control and time under tension. By slowing down the eccentric (lowering) phase, weâ€™re working on strength and stability in the chest, shoulders, and triceps. This is crucial for building a solid foundation for heavier lifts in the future.\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n  1. **Setup:** Lie flat on a bench with your feet firmly planted on the ground. Grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n  2. **Unrack the Bar:** With a spotter if needed, lift the bar off the rack and hold it above your chest with arms fully extended.\n  3. **Lowering Phase:** Slowly lower the bar to your chest over a count of three seconds. Focus on keeping your elbows at about a 45-degree angle to your body.\n  4. **Pause:** Once the bar touches your chest, pause for one second. This is where you build stability.\n  5. **Press Up:** Drive through your feet and push the bar back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n  - Keep your shoulder blades retracted and pressed into the bench.\n  - Maintain a neutral wrist position; donâ€™t let your wrists bend back excessively.\n  - Engage your core throughout the movement to protect your lower back.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n  - If youâ€™re new to bench pressing, consider using a lighter weight or performing the movement with dumbbells.\n  - If you have shoulder issues, you can substitute with a floor press or use a lighter weight.\n\n- **Loading:**\n  - **Sweat:** Start at 40% of your 1RM, aiming for 40-50% of your max.\n  - **Train:** Build to 65% of your 1RM.\n  - **Compete:** Aim for 70% of your 1RM.\n\n## Conditioning Segment [For Time]\n### 2. **3 Rounds for Time:**\n- **20 Double Dumbbell Box Step Ups (24\"/20\")**\n- **15 Dumbbell Push-ups**\n- **1 Big Hill Farmer's Carry**\n- **15 Dumbbell Push-ups**\n\n### Breakdown of Each Movement\n\n#### **20 Double Dumbbell Box Step Ups**\n- **Overview:** This movement is great for building leg strength and stability while also getting your heart rate up. Itâ€™s functional and mimics everyday movements.\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n  1. Stand in front of a sturdy box with a dumbbell in each hand, arms at your sides.\n  2. Step up onto the box with one foot, driving through your heel.\n  3. Bring your other foot up to meet the first on top of the box.\n  4. Step back down one foot at a time and repeat.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n  - Keep your chest up and core engaged throughout the movement.\n  - Ensure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down.\n  - Alternate legs with each rep for balance.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n  - Use a lower box if youâ€™re new to this movement.\n  - If dumbbells are too challenging, you can perform step-ups without weights.\n\n#### **15 Dumbbell Push-ups**\n- **Overview:** This variation of push-ups adds an extra challenge by elevating your hands, which increases the range of motion and engages your chest and triceps more.\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n  1. Start in a plank position with a dumbbell in each hand, shoulder-width apart.\n  2. Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the ground, keeping elbows close to your body.\n  3. Push back up to the starting position.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n  - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.\n  - Engage your core and avoid sagging your hips.\n  - If you feel strain in your wrists, adjust your grip or switch to kneeling push-ups.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n  - Perform push-ups from your knees if needed.\n  - Use lighter dumbbells or perform standard push-ups on the floor.\n\n#### **1 Big Hill Farmer's Carry**\n- **Overview:** This is a great way to build grip strength and core stability while also working your legs and cardiovascular system.\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n  1. Grab a heavy dumbbell in each hand and stand tall.\n  2. Walk a designated distance uphill, keeping your shoulders back and core engaged.\n  3. Maintain a steady pace and focus on your breathing.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n  - Keep your arms straight at your sides, donâ€™t let them swing.\n  - Maintain an upright posture; avoid leaning forward.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n  - Use lighter dumbbells if the weight is too challenging.\n  - Shorten the distance if youâ€™re new to this movement.\n\n### Loading Options\n- **Sweat:** 15/10 kg dumbbells; consider kneeling push-ups for scaling.\n- **Train:** 17.5/12.5 kg dumbbells.\n- **Compete:** 22.5/15 kg dumbbells.\n\n### Strategy Advice\n- For the conditioning piece, aim for a steady pace. Itâ€™s better to break up the push-ups into smaller sets than to burn out early. Focus on maintaining good form throughout, especially as you get tired. Remember, itâ€™s not just about finishing fast; itâ€™s about finishing strong!\n\nAlright team, letâ€™s get after it today!
