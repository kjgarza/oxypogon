Today’s WOD is designed for quality, focusing on building endurance and strength through a series of movements that will challenge your cardiovascular system and muscular endurance. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while keeping a steady pace. Let’s break it down!</p><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Workout Components</h4><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For the Row: Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent, back straight, and arms extended. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For the Ski Erg: Stand tall, grip the handles, and start with your arms extended. Engage your core, and pull the handles down while driving your knees slightly forward. Use your legs to help generate power.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For rowing, focus on a smooth, controlled pull rather than rushing through it.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For the Ski Erg, maintain a rhythm with your legs and arms working together.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or 1:30.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">You can also switch to a stationary bike or elliptical if available.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand in front of the box with your feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box. Bring your other foot up to meet it, then step back down one foot at a time.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your chest up and engage your core to maintain balance.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Drive through your heel to activate your glutes and hamstrings.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lower box to reduce the height if needed.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">You can also perform step-ups onto a sturdy bench or platform.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, kettlebell on the ground between your feet. Hinge at your hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands. Stand up, pulling the kettlebell up along your body, leading with your elbows until it reaches chest height.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your back flat and chest up during the hinge.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Ensure your elbows stay high and outside as you pull the kettlebell.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If kettlebells are unavailable, you can substitute with dumbbells.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">4. Ring Rows (10 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them. Grab the rings with an overhand grip, lean back, and keep your body straight. Pull your chest towards the rings while keeping your elbows close to your body.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Engage your core to maintain a straight line from head to heels.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Avoid letting your hips sag or your shoulders round forward.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows on a barbell or use a TRX strap.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier or harder.</li><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Loading and Rep-Modification Options</h4><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Sweat:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: 2:00</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Box Step-Ups: 16/8 (lower box)</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Kettlebell: 16kg/8kg</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Ring Rows: 8 reps</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Train:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: 3:00</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Box Step-Ups: 20 reps</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Kettlebell: 20kg/12kg</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Ring Rows: 10 reps</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Compete:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: 3:00</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Box Step-Ups: 20 reps</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Kettlebell: 24kg/16kg</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Ring Rows: 10 reps</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Strategy Advice</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the workout.
