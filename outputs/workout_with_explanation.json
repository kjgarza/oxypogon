Today’s WOD is all about quality and building endurance while focusing on proper movement patterns. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of a mix of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain a steady pace and focus on form throughout each movement. Remember, it’s not just about getting through the rounds; it’s about doing each rep with intention and quality.</p><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Workout Components</h4><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For the rower, sit with your feet secured and grab the handle.

Box Step-Ups (20 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand facing the box with your feet hip-width apart.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Step up onto the box with one foot, driving through your heel, and bring the other foot up to meet it.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Step back down with the same foot and repeat, alternating legs.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your chest up and engage your core to maintain balance.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Make sure your entire foot is on the box to avoid slipping.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If you have knee issues, consider doing step-ups without weights or using a platform instead.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Place the kettlebell between your feet.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Hinge at your hips and bend your knees to grab the kettlebell with both hands.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up along your body to your chin, keeping your elbows high.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Lower the kettlebell back down and repeat.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your back flat and chest up during the hinge.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use your legs to initiate the pull, not just your arms.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lighter kettlebell or perform the movement without weight to focus on form.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">4. Ring Rows (10 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back with your arms extended.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together, and then lower back down.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Avoid letting your hips sag or your back arch.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier or harder.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If rings are too challenging, you can substitute with inverted rows using a barbell.</li><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Loading and Rep-Modification Options</h4><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Sweat:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lighter kettlebell (16/8 kg) and focus on form and technique.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Train:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a moderate kettlebell (20/12 kg) and aim for consistent pacing throughout the rounds.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Compete:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a heavier kettlebell (24/16 kg) and push your limits while maintaining quality reps.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Strategy Advice</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the workout.
