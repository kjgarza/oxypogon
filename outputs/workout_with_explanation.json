Today’s WOD is all about quality and consistency, focusing on building endurance and strength through a series of movements that will challenge your cardiovascular system and muscular endurance. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while keeping a steady pace. Let’s break it down step by step!\n\n## Workout Components\n\n### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    - For the Row: Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and your shins vertical. \n    - Push through your heels, extend your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest, keeping your elbows close.\n    - Reverse the motion: extend your arms, hinge at the hips, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.\n    - For the Ski Erg: Stand tall, grip the handles, and initiate the movement by pulling down with your arms while bending your knees slightly.\n    - Use your legs to drive the movement, keeping your core engaged.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n    - Keep your back straight and core tight to avoid rounding your spine.\n    - In rowing, focus on a smooth, controlled motion rather than rushing through it.\n    - In the Ski Erg, keep your movements fluid and avoid jerking.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n    - If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or focus on maintaining a steady pace rather than intensity.\n\n### 2. Box Step-ups (20 reps)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    - Stand in front of the box with your feet hip-width apart.\n    - Step up onto the box with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body.\n    - Bring your other foot up to meet the first on the box, then step back down one foot at a time.\n    - Alternate legs with each rep.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n    - Keep your chest up and shoulders back throughout the movement.\n    - Ensure your entire foot is on the box to maintain balance and stability.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.\n    - You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on form.\n\n### 3.
