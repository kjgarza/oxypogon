Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest, keeping your elbows close.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">For the Ski Erg: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grasp the handles with both hands. Start with your arms extended overhead, then pull down while bending your knees slightly, engaging your core.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your back straight and avoid hunching over.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Maintain a steady rhythm; don’t rush!</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or even 1:30 to focus on form.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Consider using a lighter resistance setting on the Ski Erg if needed.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box. Bring the other foot up to meet it, then step back down one foot at a time.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Make sure your entire foot is on the box to avoid slipping.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on balance and stability.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out.

Stand up, pulling the kettlebell up along your body to your chin, leading with your elbows.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your back flat and engage your glutes as you lift.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Your elbows should be higher than your wrists at the top of the pull.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement or if you’re feeling fatigued.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If kettlebells aren’t available, you can substitute with dumbbells.</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">4. Ring Rows (10 reps)</h5><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Technique Steps:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them. Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight. Pull your chest towards the rings while keeping your elbows close to your sides.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Form Tips:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Keep your core engaged and avoid sagging your hips.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Focus on pulling with your back, not just your arms.</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Scaling/Modifications:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows on a barbell or use a TRX strap.</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier or harder.</li><br><h4 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Loading and Rep-Modification Options</h4><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Sweat:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: 2:00</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Box Step-Ups: 16/8 (no weights)</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Kettlebell: 12 kg/8 kg</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Ring Rows: 8 reps</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Train:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: 3:00</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Box Step-Ups: 20/12 (light weight)</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Kettlebell: 16 kg/12 kg</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Ring Rows: 10 reps</li><br><li class=\"ml-4\">**Compete:**</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Row/Ski: 3:00</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Box Step-Ups: 24/16 (weighted)</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Kettlebell: 24 kg/16 kg</li><li class=\"ml-4\">Ring Rows: 12 reps</li><br><h5 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2\">Strategy Advice</h5><br><p class=\"mb-2\">As you tackle this WOD, remember to pace yourself. It’s easy to go out too fast, especially on the row or ski, but maintaining a steady rhythm will help you through all six rounds. Focus on quality over quantity; it’s better to do fewer reps with good form than to rush and risk injury.
