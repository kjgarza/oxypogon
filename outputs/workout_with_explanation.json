Today’s WOD is a fun and challenging combination of strength, coordination, and core stability. We’ll be tackling a conditioning piece that involves a series of movements designed to get your heart rate up while building strength and endurance. The structure is a ladder format, where we’ll increase the reps as we go. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout and to push your limits while listening to your body. Let’s break it down!\n\n## Conditioning Segment [For Time]\n\n### 10-20-30-40 Ladder\n\nThis part of the workout consists of four movements: Single Dumbbell Push Jerks, Bear Crawls, and Toes to Bar, with a Bear Crawl in between each set. The rep scheme increases as you progress, so pace yourself and focus on quality reps!\n\n### 1. Single Dumbbell Push Jerks\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n  1. Start with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in one hand at shoulder height.\n  2. Dip slightly by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.\n  3. Explode upward, driving through your legs while pressing the dumbbell overhead.\n  4. Lock out your arm at the top, ensuring your bicep is close to your ear.\n  5. Lower the dumbbell back to the shoulder and repeat.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n  - Keep your core engaged to stabilize your body.\n  - Use your legs to generate power; don’t rely solely on your arms.\n  - Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n  - Use a lighter dumbbell if you’re new to this movement.\n  - If you have shoulder issues, consider doing a strict press instead.\n\n### 2. Bear Crawl (15 Meters)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n  1. Start on all fours, with your hands under your shoulders and knees under your hips.\n  2. Lift your knees slightly off the ground, keeping your back flat.\n  3. Move your right hand and left foot forward simultaneously, followed by your left hand and right foot.\n  4. Keep your hips low and your core tight as you crawl forward.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n  - Maintain a neutral spine; avoid arching your back.\n  - Keep your movements controlled and deliberate.\n  - Breathe steadily to maintain your rhythm.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n  - If crawling is difficult, you can walk on your knees instead.\n  - Reduce the distance to 10 meters if needed.\n\n### 3. Toes to Bar (15 Reps)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n  1. Hang from a pull-up bar with a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width.\n  2. Engage your core and initiate the movement by bringing your knees up towards your chest.\n  3. As your knees rise, extend your legs and aim to touch your toes to the bar.\n  4. Lower back down with control and repeat.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n  - Keep your shoulders engaged and avoid swinging.\n  - Use a kipping motion if you’re comfortable, but focus on core engagement.\n  \n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n  - If you can’t reach the bar, do knee raises instead.\n  - Use a lower bar or perform hanging leg raises if needed.\n\n### Loading Options:\n\n- **Sweat:** 17.5/12.5 kg DB; substitute with 15 Knee Raises instead of Toes to Bar.\n- **Train:** 22.5/17.5 kg DB; perform 10 Toes to Bar.\n- **Compete:** 25/20 kg DB; stick with the full Toes to Bar.\n\n### Strategy Advice:\n\n- Start at a steady pace; it’s better to break up the reps early than to burn out.\n- Focus on maintaining good form, especially as you get tired.\n- Use the Bear Crawls as a recovery between movements; keep them controlled.\n\n## Accessory Segment [4 Sets of Quality]\n\nNow, we’ll move on to some accessory work to build core strength and stability. This part is all about quality over quantity.\n\n### 1. Tuck Ups (12 Reps)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n  1. Sit on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat.\n  2. Lean back slightly, keeping your back straight.\n  3. Extend your legs out while simultaneously reaching your arms forward.\n  4. Pull your knees back to your chest while bringing your arms in.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n  - Keep your core engaged throughout the movement.\n  - Avoid rounding your back; maintain a strong posture.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n  - If this is too challenging, try doing them with your feet on the ground.\n  - You can also perform the movement with a slight lean back for support.\n\n### 2. Hollow Rocks (15-20 Sec)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n  1. Lie on your back with your arms extended overhead and legs straight.\n  2. Lift your shoulders and legs off the ground, creating a \"hollow\" position.\n  3. Rock gently back and forth, maintaining the hollow position.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n  - Keep your lower back pressed into the ground.\n  - Engage your core to maintain stability.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n  - If rocking is too difficult, hold the hollow position without movement.\n  - Bend your knees to make it easier.\n\n### 3. AMRAP Hollow Hold\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n  1. Lie on your back, arms overhead, and legs extended.\n  2. Lift your shoulders and legs off the ground, holding the position.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n  - Focus on keeping your lower back flat against the ground.\n  - Breathe steadily and maintain tension in your core.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n  - Bend your knees or keep your feet on the ground for an easier hold.\n\n### Summary\n\nAlright, team! Remember to focus on quality movements throughout the WOD. It’s not just about finishing quickly; it’s about building strength and maintaining good form. Listen to your body, scale as needed, and enjoy the workout! Let’s get after it!"}}
