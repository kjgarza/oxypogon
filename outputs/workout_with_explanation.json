Todayâ€™s WOD is designed to build endurance and strength while focusing on quality movement. Weâ€™ll be doing 6 rounds of a mix of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement, ensuring weâ€™re not just going through the motions but really engaging our muscles and building that functional strength. \n\nLetâ€™s break it down step by step!\n\n## Workout Components\n\n### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    - **Rowing:** Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and your back straight. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest.\n    - **Ski Erg:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grab the handles, and start with your arms extended. Use your legs to drive down while pulling the handles down toward your hips, engaging your core.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n    - Keep your back straight and avoid hunching over.\n    - Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.\n    - Maintain a steady, controlled pace; focus on your breathing.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n    - If youâ€™re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or even 1:30 to build up your endurance.\n    - Focus on technique over speed; itâ€™s better to row or ski slower with good form than faster with poor form.\n\n### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)\n\n- **Technique Steps:**\n    - Stand facing the box with your feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.\n    - Bring your other foot up to meet the first on the box, then step back down one foot at a time.\n\n- **Form Tips:**\n    - Keep your chest up and engage your core as you step.\n    - Use your leg muscles to lift yourself, not your back.\n    - Alternate legs for each rep to ensure balanced strength development.\n\n- **Scaling/Modifications:**\n    - Use a lower box if youâ€™re not comfortable with the height.\n    - If you have knee issues, consider doing step-ups onto a lower surface or perform box squats instead.\n\n### 3.
