## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality and consistency. We’re diving into a 6-round workout that combines some cardio, strength, and bodyweight movements. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while pushing your limits. Remember, it’s not just about finishing; it’s about how well you perform each movement. Let’s break it down!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - For the Row: Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and back straight.
    - Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - Reverse the motion: extend your arms, lean forward, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.
    - For the Ski Erg: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grasp the handles with both hands. 
    - Engage your core, and pull down with your arms while driving your knees slightly forward.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and avoid hunching over.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement; your arms should follow.
    - For the Ski Erg, focus on a smooth, controlled pull rather than yanking.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing, aim for a slower pace to focus on technique.
    - For the Ski Erg, you can reduce the time to 2:00 if needed.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart.
    - Step up onto the box with one foot, driving through your heel to lift your body up.
    - Bring the other foot up to meet the first on top of the box, then step back down one foot at a time.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
    - Use your legs to push up, not your back.
    - Alternate the leading foot each round to ensure balanced work.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - If you have knee issues, consider doing step-ups without weights or using a sturdy platform.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out.
    - Place the kettlebell between your feet. Hinge at the hips and grab the kettlebell with both hands.
    - Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up along your body, leading with your elbows.
    - Lower the kettlebell back down to the ground in a controlled manner.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and chest up during the lift.
    - Focus on using your legs and hips to drive the movement, not just your arms.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - If kettlebells are unavailable, you can substitute with dumbbells or perform a bodyweight squat.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back comfortably.
    - Grab the rings with an overhand grip and lean back, keeping your body straight.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings by bending your elbows and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
    - Lower yourself back to the starting position with control.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body straight from head to heels; avoid sagging your hips.
    - Engage your core throughout the movement to maintain stability.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows on a bar or use a TRX.
    - For a simpler version, do bent-over rows with a dumbbell.

### Strategy Advice

As you tackle this WOD, remember to pace yourself. It’s easy to go out too fast, especially on the rower or ski erg. Focus on maintaining quality reps throughout each round. Break up the kettlebell high pulls and ring rows if you start to feel fatigued. Listen to your body, and don’t hesitate to scale if needed. Let’s have some fun and crush this workout together!
