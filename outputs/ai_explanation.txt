## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality and movement efficiency. We’re going to tackle 6 rounds of a mix of cardio, strength, and bodyweight movements. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while focusing on your breathing and pacing. This workout is designed to build endurance, strength, and coordination, so let’s break it down!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - **Rowing:** Sit on the rower with your feet secured. Start with your knees bent and arms extended. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - **Ski Erg:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grasp the handles. Start with your arms extended, then pull down and back while bending your knees slightly, engaging your core.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and core engaged.
    - For rowing, focus on driving with your legs first, then pulling with your arms.
    - For the Ski Erg, use your legs to assist in the pull, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing, aim for a slower pace to focus on technique.
    - For the Ski Erg, reduce the time to 2:00 if needed.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand in front of the box with feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through the heel to lift your body onto the box. Step down with the same foot and repeat on the other side.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and core tight.
    - Ensure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - If you have knee issues, consider stepping onto a sturdy platform or performing a seated leg lift instead.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, toes pointed slightly out. Hold the kettlebell with both hands in front of you. Hinge at the hips, lowering the kettlebell between your legs. Drive through your heels, extending your hips and pulling the kettlebell up to your chin.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and chest up during the hinge.
    - Elbows should be higher than your wrists at the top of the pull.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - If kettlebells are unavailable, you can perform dumbbell high pulls or even bodyweight squats.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them while standing. Grab the rings with an overhand grip, lean back, and pull your chest towards the rings while keeping your body straight.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
    - Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Adjust the height of the rings to make it easier (lower) or harder (higher).
    - If rings are not available, substitute with inverted rows using a barbell or a TRX.

### Strategy Advice

- **Pacing:** Start each round with a steady pace, especially on the row/Ski Erg. It’s easy to go too hard at the beginning, so find a rhythm that you can maintain.
- **Breaks:** Don’t hesitate to take short breaks during the kettlebell and step-ups if you feel your form slipping. Quality over quantity is key today!
- **Breathing:** Focus on your breathing throughout the workout. Inhale during the easier parts and exhale during the exertion.

Alright team, let’s get after it! Remember, focus on quality movements, and have fun with it!
