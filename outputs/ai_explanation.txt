## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Todayâ€™s WOD is designed to build endurance and strength while focusing on quality movement. Weâ€™ll be doing 6 rounds of a mix of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement, ensuring weâ€™re not just going through the motions but really engaging our muscles and building that functional strength. 

Letâ€™s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - **Rowing:** Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and your back straight. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest.
    - **Ski Erg:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grab the handles, and start with your arms extended. Use your legs to drive down while pulling the handles down toward your hips, engaging your core.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and avoid hunching over.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.
    - Maintain a steady, controlled pace; focus on your breathing.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If youâ€™re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or even 1:30 to build up your endurance.
    - Focus on technique over speed; itâ€™s better to row or ski slower with good form than faster with poor form.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with your feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
    - Bring your other foot up to meet the first on the box, then step back down one foot at a time.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core as you step.
    - Use your leg muscles to lift yourself, not your back.
    - Alternate legs for each rep to ensure balanced strength development.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if youâ€™re not comfortable with the height.
    - If you have knee issues, consider doing step-ups onto a lower surface or perform box squats instead.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes pointed slightly out. Place the kettlebell between your feet.
    - Hinge at your hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands. Keep your back flat and chest up.
    - Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up to your chin, leading with your elbows.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep the kettlebell close to your body throughout the movement.
    - Engage your core and avoid rounding your back.
    - Use your legs to initiate the movement, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if youâ€™re new to this movement or if your form is breaking down.
    - If kettlebells are not available, you can substitute with dumbbell high pulls.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to pull yourself up comfortably. Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels; avoid sagging your hips.
    - Engage your core throughout the movement to maintain stability.
    - Control your descent; donâ€™t just drop back down.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows using a barbell or a sturdy table.
    - Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier or harder.

### Strategy Advice

- Focus on quality over quantity. Take your time to ensure each rep is performed correctly.
- Break up the movements into manageable sets if needed, especially if you start to feel fatigued.
- Keep a steady pace on the rower or ski erg; itâ€™s better to maintain a consistent effort than to go all out and burn out early.
