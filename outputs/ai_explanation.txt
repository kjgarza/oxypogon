## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is structured for quality, focusing on building endurance and strength through a series of movements that will challenge your cardiovascular system and muscular endurance. We’ll be completing 6 rounds of rowing or skiing, followed by box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout and to keep a steady pace, ensuring that you’re working hard but also staying safe.

## Workout Components Breakdown

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - For the rower: Sit with your feet strapped in, grab the handle, and start with your knees bent and back straight.
    - Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - Reverse the motion: extend your arms, hinge at the hips, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.
    - For the Ski Erg: Stand tall, hold the handles, and initiate the movement by pulling down with your arms while engaging your core and legs.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or use a lower resistance setting.
    - Alternatively, you can perform a light jog or jump rope for the same duration.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand in front of the box with your feet hip-width apart.
    - Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
    - Bring your other foot up to meet the first, then step back down one foot at a time.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and core engaged throughout the movement.
    - Ensure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down to maintain balance.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out, with the kettlebell on the floor between your feet.
    - Hinge at the hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands.
    - Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up along your body, leading with your elbows.
    - Finish with the kettlebell at chest height, then lower it back down to the floor.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and engage your core throughout the lift.
    - Ensure the kettlebell stays close to your body during the pull.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell or perform the movement with a dumbbell.
    - If you’re new to this movement, you can practice the deadlift motion without the high pull.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them while standing.
    - Grab the rings with an overhand grip and lean back, keeping your body straight.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings by bending your elbows and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
    - Lower yourself back to the starting position with control.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
    - Avoid letting your hips sag or your shoulders round forward.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If ring rows are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows using a barbell or TRX straps.
    - Alternatively, you can do bent-over dumbbell rows for a similar effect.

### Strategy Advice

As you move through this WOD, focus on maintaining a steady pace rather than going all out. It’s better to break up your sets if you need to, especially on the kettlebell high pulls and ring rows, to ensure you maintain good form. Remember, quality over quantity! Keep your transitions smooth and stay hydrated. Let’s have some fun and crush this workout together!
