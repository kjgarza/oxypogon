## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is called "ADDERALL," and it’s designed to test your cardiovascular endurance and strength under fatigue. We’ll be doing three AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) segments, each with a running component followed by a strength movement. The goal here is to push your limits while maintaining good form, so let’s break it down step by step!

## AMRAP 10: 1600 Meter Run + Max Clean and Jerks (W1)

### 1. 1600 Meter Run

- **Technique Steps:**
  - Start with a steady pace; find a rhythm that you can maintain for the full distance.
  - Focus on your breathing; inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth.
  - Keep your shoulders relaxed and arms at a 90-degree angle, swinging them naturally as you run.

- **Form Tips:**
  - Land softly on your feet to reduce impact.
  - Keep your head up and look ahead, not down at your feet.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
  - If you're new to running or have any injuries, consider scaling to a 1200-meter run or a brisk walk.
  - You can also substitute with a row or bike for a similar cardio effect.

### 2. Max Clean and Jerks

- **Technique Steps:**
  - Start with the barbell on the ground; set your feet hip-width apart.
  - Grip the bar just outside your knees, keeping your back flat and chest up.
  - Initiate the lift by driving through your heels, extending your hips and knees simultaneously.
  - Pull the bar up to your shoulders (the clean), then dip slightly and drive the bar overhead (the jerk).
  - Catch the bar in a partial squat, then stand tall to finish.

- **Form Tips:**
  - Keep the bar close to your body throughout the lift.
  - Ensure your elbows are high during the clean to create a strong shelf for the bar.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
  - Use a lighter barbell or a pair of dumbbells if you're still mastering the technique.
  - If you’re not comfortable with the full clean and jerk, you can do a power clean followed by a push press.

## AMRAP 7: 800 Meter Run + Max Power Snatches (W2)

### 1. 800 Meter Run

- **Technique Steps:**

  - Maintain a steady pace but feel free to pick it up towards the end if you have energy left.

- **Form Tips:**
  - Keep your arms relaxed and your stride efficient.
  - Focus on your foot placement; aim for a mid-foot strike.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
  - Scale to a 600-meter run or substitute with a row or bike if needed.

### 2. Max Power Snatches

- **Technique Steps:**
  - Start with the barbell on the ground, feet hip-width apart.
  - Grip the bar just outside your knees, keeping your back flat.
  - Explosively extend your hips and pull the bar overhead in one fluid motion.
  - Catch the bar in a quarter squat, then stand tall.

- **Form Tips:**
  - Keep the bar close to your body and use your legs to drive the weight up.
  - Focus on a strong catch position to stabilize the bar overhead.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
  - Use lighter weights or a dumbbell for single-arm snatches if needed.
  - If you’re not comfortable with the full snatch, consider doing a hang power snatch.

## Strategy Advice

- **Pacing:** Start each run at a manageable pace, and save some energy for the strength movements. 
- **Breaks:** For the strength components, break your sets into manageable chunks to avoid burnout.
- **Focus on Form:** As you get tired, it’s easy to let form slip. Remember, quality over quantity!
