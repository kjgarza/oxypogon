## Strength Segment: Power Clean
### 1. **Power Clean**
- **Technique Steps:**
    1. **Setup:** Start with your feet hip-width apart, barbell over the midfoot, and your shins close to the bar.
    2. **Grip:** Bend at the hips and knees to grab the bar with a grip just outside your knees.
    3. **First Pull:** Stand up by extending your knees while keeping your back straight, lifting the bar to just above the knees.
    4. **Second Pull:** As the bar reaches knee height, explosively extend your hips and shrug your shoulders, pulling the bar up.
    5. **Catch:** Drop under the bar, rotating your elbows around and catching it on your shoulders in a quarter squat.
    6. **Stand:** Stand tall to finish the lift.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep the bar close to your body throughout the lift.
    - Focus on driving through your heels during the second pull.
    - Ensure your elbows are high and your chest is up when catching the bar.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If youâ€™re new to the Power Clean, start with a PVC pipe or a lighter barbell to master the technique.
    - You can also practice with dumbbells or kettlebells if youâ€™re not comfortable with the barbell yet.

- **Loading:**
    - Start at 40-50% of your 1RM and aim to build up to 70-75% over the six sets. Focus on maintaining good form rather than just lifting heavy.

## Strategy Advice
- **Pacing:** Start with a steady pace, especially on the Power Cleans. Itâ€™s easy to burn out quickly, so find a rhythm that you can maintain throughout the workout.
- **Breaking Up Sets:** Donâ€™t be afraid to break up your reps early, especially on the Toes to Bar and Push-Ups. Itâ€™s better to do smaller sets with good form than to push through and risk fatigue.
- **Transitioning:** Keep your transitions quick between movements to maintain your heart rate and stay in the zone.
