Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality and consistency. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of a mix of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to focus on your form and movement quality rather than speed. This workout will help improve your cardiovascular endurance, lower body strength, and upper body pulling strength. Let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Setup**: Sit comfortably on the rower or ski erg with your feet secured.
- **Rowing**: Start with your legs fully extended, arms straight, and back straight.
- **Pull**: Engage your legs first, then lean back slightly as you pull the handle towards your chest. 
- **Recovery**: Extend your arms, lean forward, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.
- Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.
- Maintain a steady rhythm; aim for a consistent stroke rate.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If you're new to rowing, focus on shorter intervals (1:00) or use a lower resistance.
- On the ski erg, reduce the intensity by using a lighter pull.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Setup**: Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart.
- **Step Up**: Place one foot firmly on the box, pressing through your heel to lift your body up.
- **Stand Tall**: Bring your other foot up to meet the first on the box, standing tall.
- **Step Down**: Step back down one foot at a time, maintaining control.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
- Use a box height that allows you to maintain good form without excessive strain.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lower box if you’re new to this movement or have mobility concerns.
- You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on balance and technique.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps, 24/16 kg)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Setup**: Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, kettlebell between your feet.
- **Deadlift**: Hinge at your hips and lower your body to grab the kettlebell, keeping your back straight.
- **Pull**: Drive through your heels, extending your hips and knees, and pull the kettlebell up to your chin, leading with your elbows.
- **Lower**: Reverse the movement, lowering the kettlebell back to the ground.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep the kettlebell close to your body throughout the movement.
- Ensure your elbows are higher than your wrists at the top of the pull.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement or need to focus on form.
- If kettlebells are unavailable, you can substitute with dumbbells.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Setup**: Adjust the rings to a height where you can comfortably reach them while standing.
- **Position**: Grab the rings with an overhand grip and lean back, keeping your body straight.
- **Pull**: Engage your core and pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
- **Lower**: Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
- Avoid letting your hips sag or your shoulders round forward.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If ring rows are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows using a barbell or TRX straps.
- Adjust the angle of your body to make it easier or harder.

## Loading and Rep-Modification Options

- **Sweat**: 16/8 kg kettlebell, focus on form and technique.

### Strategy Advice:
- Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the workout. Quality over quantity is key here!
- Break up the reps if needed, especially on the kettlebell high pulls and ring rows, to maintain good form.
