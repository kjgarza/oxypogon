### **Part 1: Conditioning**

#### **1. Mile Run**
**Instructions:**
1. **Warm-Up:** Start with a light jog or dynamic stretches to get your muscles ready.
2. **Form Tips:** Keep your head up, shoulders relaxed, and arms at a 90-degree angle. Your feet should land softly under your hips.
3. **Pacing:** Find a pace that you can maintain for the full mile. It‚Äôs okay to start slower and pick up speed as you go.
4. **Scaling Options:** If a mile run feels too daunting, you can scale it down to a 800m run or even a brisk walk.

#### **2. Rowing (60/45 Calories)**
**Instructions:**
1. **Setup:** Adjust the foot straps so your feet are secure but not too tight.
2. **Starting Position:** Sit tall with your back straight, knees bent, and grab the handle with both hands.
3. **The Stroke:**
   - **Drive:** Push through your heels, extend your legs, and pull the handle towards your chest while leaning back slightly.
   - **Recovery:** Extend your arms first, then lean forward from your hips, and finally bend your knees to return to the starting position.
4. **Form Tips:** Keep your core engaged and avoid hunching over. Your strokes should be powerful and smooth.
5. **Scaling Options:** If rowing is new to you, aim for 30 calories or switch to a stationary bike.

#### **3. Biking (50/35 Calories)**
**Instructions:**
1. **Setup:** Adjust the seat height so that your legs have a slight bend at the bottom of the pedal stroke.
2. **Starting Position:** Sit comfortably on the bike with your hands gripping the handlebars.
3. **Pedaling:** Keep a steady pace, using your legs to push down and pull up on the pedals.
4. **Form Tips:** Maintain a straight back and avoid leaning too far forward. Keep your core tight.
5. **Scaling Options:** If biking feels too intense, reduce the calories to 25 or switch to a light jog.

### **Part 2: Finisher**

#### **Giant Set Instructions:**
You‚Äôll perform three exercises back-to-back, resting as needed between sets. 

**1. Half Kneeling Pallof Presses (10/10)**
- **Setup:** Kneel on one knee with the opposite foot in front. Hold a resistance band or a dumbbell at your chest.
- **Press:** Extend your arms straight out in front of you, engaging your core to resist rotation.
- **Return:** Bring your arms back to your chest.
- **Tip:** Keep your hips square and avoid leaning back.

**2. Double Dumbbell French Press (10 reps)**
- **Setup:** Stand or sit with a dumbbell in each hand, arms extended overhead.
- **Lower:** Bend your elbows to lower the dumbbells behind your head.
- **Press:** Extend your arms back to the starting position.
- **Tip:** Keep your elbows close to your head to isolate the triceps.

**3. Double Dumbbell Chest Flys (10 reps)**
- **Setup:** Lie on a bench or the floor with a dumbbell in each hand, arms extended above your chest.
- **Lower:** Slowly open your arms wide, keeping a slight bend in your elbows.
- **Return:** Bring the dumbbells back together over your chest.
- **Tip:** Control the movement to avoid straining your shoulders.
