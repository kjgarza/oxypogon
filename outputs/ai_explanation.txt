## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is designed for quality, focusing on building endurance and strength through a series of movements that will challenge your cardiovascular system and muscular endurance. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while pushing your limits. Let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

**Technique Steps:**
- **Rowing:** Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your legs fully extended, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest while driving through your legs.
- **Ski Erg:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grip the handles, and initiate the movement by pulling down with your arms while engaging your core and legs.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your back straight and core engaged.
- For rowing, focus on driving with your legs first, then lean back and pull with your arms.
- For the Ski Erg, maintain a strong posture and use your legs to assist the pull.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- If you're new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or focus on technique rather than speed.
- Consider using a lower resistance setting if available.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

**Technique Steps:**
- Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart.
- Step up onto the box with one foot, driving through your heel to lift your body up.
- Step back down with the same foot and repeat on the other side.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
- Ensure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down to maintain balance.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- Use a lower box if you're not comfortable with the height.
- If you have knee issues, consider doing step-ups without weights or perform a seated leg extension instead.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

**Technique Steps:**
- Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Place the kettlebell between your feet.
- Hinge at the hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands.
- Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up towards your chin, leading with your elbows.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your back flat and core tight during the hinge.
- Ensure your elbows stay above the kettlebell as you pull it up.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- Use a lighter kettlebell if you're new to this movement or focus on the deadlift portion without the high pull.
- If kettlebells are not available, you can substitute with dumbbells.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

**Technique Steps:**
- Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them while standing.
- Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight.
- Pull your chest towards the rings while keeping your elbows close to your body.

**Form Tips:**
- Maintain a straight line from your head to your heels; avoid sagging your hips.
- Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows on a barbell or use a TRX strap.
- Adjust the angle of your body to make it easier or harder.

### Strategy Advice

- **Pacing:** Aim for a steady pace throughout the rounds. It’s better to maintain a consistent effort than to go all out and burn out quickly.
- **Breaks:** Don’t hesitate to take short breaks between movements if needed, especially on the kettlebell high pulls and ring rows, to maintain form.
- **Focus on Quality:** Remember, this workout is for quality, so prioritize your technique over speed. Good form will help you avoid injury and get the most out of your workout.
