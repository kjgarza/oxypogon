## Workout Overview
Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is a fantastic mix of strength and conditioning that’s going to challenge your upper body strength and endurance while also getting your heart rate up. We’ll start with a strength segment focusing on the Bench Press and Bent Over Y Raises, and then we’ll dive into a conditioning piece that combines Push-ups, Double DB Renegade Rows, and Double Unders. The goal here is to build strength while also working on your muscular endurance and cardiovascular fitness. Let’s break it down step by step!

## Strength Segment
### 1. **Bench Press**
- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Lie back on a flat bench with your feet firmly planted on the ground.
    2. Grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
    3. Unrack the bar and lower it slowly to your chest, keeping your elbows at about a 45-degree angle.
    4. Press the bar back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your shoulder blades retracted and your back flat against the bench.
    - Don’t let your wrists bend back; keep them straight and strong.
    - Breathe in as you lower the bar and exhale as you press it up.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to the bench press, start with a lighter weight or use dumbbells.
    - You can also perform the movement on a stability ball for added core engagement.

- **Loading:**
    - Start at 40% of your 1RM and aim to build to 70-75% over the course of the sets. Focus on maintaining good form rather than just lifting heavy.

### 2. **Bent Over Y Raises**
- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, holding a pair of dumbbells.
    2. Hinge at the hips, keeping your back flat and chest up, until your torso is almost parallel to the ground.
    3. With a slight bend in your elbows, raise the dumbbells in a Y shape above your head.
    4. Lower the weights back down with control.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your core engaged to protect your lower back.
    - Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
    - Move slowly and with control; this is about muscle engagement, not speed.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use lighter dumbbells or perform the movement without weights to focus on form.
    - If you have shoulder issues, consider doing a lateral raise instead.

## Conditioning Segment [For Time]
### 1. **Push-ups**
- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Start in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
    2. Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the ground, keeping your elbows close to your body.
    3. Push back up to the starting position.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
    - Engage your core and glutes to avoid sagging in your hips.
    - If you struggle with full push-ups, drop to your knees to maintain form.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Kneeling push-ups are a great option for beginners.
    - You can also elevate your hands on a bench or box to make it easier.

### 2. **Double DB Renegade Rows**
- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Start in a plank position with a dumbbell in each hand.
    2. Row one dumbbell to your hip while stabilizing your body with the other arm.
    3. Lower the dumbbell back down and repeat on the other side.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your hips level; avoid rotating your body as you row.
    - Engage your core to maintain stability throughout the movement.
    - Move slowly and with control to avoid swinging.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to this movement, you can perform the rows from your knees.
    - Use lighter dumbbells or perform the movement without weights to focus on form.

### 3. **Double Unders**
- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Start with the jump rope behind your heels.
    2. Jump slightly higher than a regular jump, allowing the rope to pass under your feet twice.
    3. Keep your elbows close to your body and use your wrists to turn the rope.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Focus on a consistent rhythm and try to keep your jumps low.
    - Practice the timing of the jump and the rope turning to find your groove.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re not comfortable with double unders, stick with single unders or perform 60 single unders instead.

## Loading and Rep-Modification Options
- **Sweat Option:**
    - Use 15/10 kg dumbbells for the Renegade Rows and perform kneeling push-ups with 120 single unders. This is a great option for those looking to maintain a steady pace without overexerting.

- **Train Option:**
    - Use 17.5/12.5 kg dumbbells and perform regular push-ups with 45 double unders. This is a balanced approach for those looking to challenge themselves while maintaining good form.

- **Compete Option:**
    - Use 22.5/15 kg dumbbells and go for full push-ups with 60 double unders. This is for those who are looking to push their limits and test their endurance.

## Strategy Advice
As you tackle this WOD, remember to pace yourself, especially during the conditioning segment. Break up your sets early if you need to, particularly on the Push-ups and Renegade Rows, to avoid burnout. Focus on maintaining good form throughout, and don’t hesitate to scale if needed. Let’s have fun and crush this workout together!
