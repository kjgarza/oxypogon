## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is designed to be a quality-focused workout that emphasizes endurance, strength, and technique. We’ll be going through six rounds of rowing or skiing, followed by some box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement while keeping a steady pace. Let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - For the Row: Sit on the rower with your feet secured. Start with your knees bent and your shins vertical. Grab the handle with both hands, keeping your arms straight.
    - Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest while keeping your elbows tucked.
    - Reverse the motion: extend your arms, lean forward, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.
    - For the Ski Erg: Stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart. Grip the handles with both hands, keeping your arms straight.
    - Engage your core and pull the handles down towards your hips, using your legs and arms in a coordinated motion.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement.
    - Avoid overextending your back; maintain a neutral spine.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing, consider reducing the time to 2:00 or using a lighter resistance on the Ski Erg.
    - Focus on technique rather than speed.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with your feet hip-width apart.
    - Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
    - Bring your other foot up to meet the first, standing tall at the top.
    - Step back down one foot at a time and repeat.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core to maintain balance.
    - Use your legs to power up, not your back.
    - Alternate legs for each rep or complete all reps on one leg before switching.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - If you have knee issues, consider doing step-ups without weights or using a platform.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out. Place the kettlebell between your feet.
    - Hinge at your hips and bend your knees to grab the kettlebell with both hands.
    - Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up along your body, leading with your elbows.
    - At the top, your elbows should be above the kettlebell, and then lower it back down to the starting position.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep the kettlebell close to your body throughout the movement.
    - Engage your lats to help pull the kettlebell up.
    - Maintain a neutral spine and avoid rounding your back.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell or perform the movement without weight to focus on form.
    - If you’re new to this movement, consider doing kettlebell deadlifts instead.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back with your arms extended.
    - Grab the rings with an overhand grip and lean back, keeping your body straight.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings by bending your elbows and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
    - Lower yourself back down with control.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
    - Avoid using momentum; focus on controlled movements.
    - Engage your core to prevent sagging in your hips.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier or harder.
    - If rings are too challenging, substitute with inverted rows using a barbell or TRX straps.

### Strategy Advice

- Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the workout. It’s better to go slower and keep good form than to rush and risk injury.
- Break up the movements into manageable sets if needed, especially on the kettlebell high pulls and ring rows.
- Stay hydrated and listen to your body; if you need to take a breather, that’s perfectly okay!
