## Workout Overview
Hey everyone! Todayâ€™s WOD is a fantastic blend of strength and conditioning that will really challenge your power and endurance. Weâ€™ll kick things off with a strength segment focusing on the Hang Power Clean, where weâ€™ll work on technique and gradually increase our load. Then, weâ€™ll dive into a conditioning piece that combines high-rep Hang Power Cleans with a rowing challenge, pushing your cardiovascular limits. Finally, weâ€™ll finish strong with a quick finisher to target the upper back and glutes. Letâ€™s break it down step by step!

## Strength Segment
### 1. **Hang Power Clean**
- **Structure:** Weâ€™ll perform 6 Hang Power Cleans every 2:30 for 5 sets, starting at 40-50% of your 1 Rep Max (1RM) and building up to 65-70%.

#### Technique Steps:
1. **Starting Position:** Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart, barbell resting on your thighs.
2. **Hinge:** Push your hips back while keeping your chest up, allowing the bar to slide down to just above your knees.
3. **Explosive Pull:** Drive through your legs, extending your hips and knees, and pull the bar up while shrugging your shoulders.
4. **Catch Position:** As the bar reaches its peak, drop under it into a quarter squat, catching it on your shoulders with elbows high.
5. **Stand Up:** Stand tall to finish the rep, then reset for the next one.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep the bar close to your body throughout the movement.
- Focus on using your legs to drive the bar up rather than just your arms.
- Maintain a strong core to stabilize your body during the catch.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If youâ€™re new to this movement, practice with a PVC pipe or lighter weights to focus on form.
- You can also perform the Hang Clean with dumbbells if a barbell isnâ€™t available.

#### Loading:
- **Sweat:** Start with 40-50% of your 1RM.
- **Train:** Aim for 55-65% of your 1RM.
- **Compete:** Work up to 65-70% of your 1RM.

## Conditioning Segment [6 x 1:30 Intervals]
### 2. **Interval Workout:**
- **Structure:** Youâ€™ll perform 10 Hang Power Cleans followed by max calorie row for the remaining time in each 1:30 interval, resting for 1:30 between intervals.

#### Hang Power Cleans:
- **Technique:** Same as above, focusing on maintaining form even as you fatigue.
  
#### Max Calorie Row:
1. **Set Up:** Sit on the rower with your feet secured and grab the handle.
2. **Start Position:** Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest.
3. **Drive:** Use your legs to initiate the pull, then lean back and pull with your arms.
4. **Finish:** Extend your arms and lean forward to reset for the next stroke.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your back straight and core engaged during the row.
- Aim for a smooth, powerful stroke rather than rushing through.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If youâ€™re not comfortable with the Hang Power Clean, reduce the weight or perform a different pulling movement like kettlebell swings.
- For the row, you can adjust the intensity by rowing at a slower pace or reducing the time to 1 minute.

#### Loading Options:
- **Sweat:** 30/20 kg (lighter weights).
- **Train:** 45/30 kg (moderate weights).
- **Compete:** 60/40 kg (heavier weights).

#### Strategy Advice:
- Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the intervals. Donâ€™t go all out on the first round; save some energy for the later rounds. Break up the Hang Power Cleans if needed to maintain good form.

## Finisher (Time Cap: 5 minutes)
### 3. **1 Round:**
- **40 Banded Face Pulls**
- **25/25 Single Leg Glute Bridges**

#### Banded Face Pulls:
1. **Set Up:** Attach a resistance band at chest height.
2. **Grip:** Hold the band with both hands, arms extended in front of you.
3. **Pull:** Pull the band towards your face, keeping your elbows high and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
4. **Return:** Slowly return to the starting position.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your core engaged and avoid leaning back.
- Focus on the contraction in your upper back.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lighter band or perform seated rows if you donâ€™t have access to bands.

#### Single Leg Glute Bridges:
1. **Starting Position:** Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor.
2. **Lift:** Extend one leg and push through the heel of the other foot to lift your hips towards the ceiling.
3. **Squeeze:** At the top, squeeze your glutes before lowering back down.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your shoulders and head on the ground.
- Avoid overarching your lower back; focus on using your glutes.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If single-leg is too challenging, perform regular glute bridges with both feet on the ground.
