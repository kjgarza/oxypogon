## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps**:
    - **Rowing**: Sit on the rower with your feet secured. Start with your knees bent and arms extended. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - **Ski Erg**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Grip the handles, and initiate the movement by pulling down with your arms while engaging your core and driving your knees slightly forward.
  
- **Form Tips**:
    - Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement.
    - For rowing, focus on a smooth, powerful leg drive followed by the pull.
    - For skiing, think about using your whole body, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - If you’re new to rowing, aim for a lower intensity or shorter duration (like 2:00).
    - For Ski Erg, you can also reduce the time or switch to a rowing machine if you’re more comfortable with that.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps**:
    - Stand facing the box with your feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
    - Bring your other foot up to the box, then step back down one foot at a time.

- **Form Tips**:
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core as you step up.
    - Make sure your entire foot is on the box to avoid any slips.

- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on balance and form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps**:
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out. Place the kettlebell between your feet.
    - Hinge at your hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands. Stand up, driving through your heels, and as you stand, pull the kettlebell up to your chin, keeping your elbows high.

- **Form Tips**:
    - Maintain a flat back and engage your lats as you pull.
    - Keep the kettlebell close to your body throughout the movement.

- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - If kettlebells are unavailable, you can substitute with dumbbells or perform a bodyweight squat.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps**:
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back with your arms extended. Grab the rings and walk your feet forward until your body is at an angle.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings, keeping your body straight and core engaged, then lower back down.

- **Form Tips**:
    - Keep your elbows close to your body and avoid flaring them out.
    - Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.

- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - If rings are too challenging, you can use a barbell set at waist height for inverted rows.
    - Alternatively, perform bent-over rows with a dumbbell or kettlebell.
