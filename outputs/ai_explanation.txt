## Workout Overview
Hey team! Today we’re tackling a classic benchmark workout known as "BADGER." This WOD is structured as three rounds for time, which means we’re looking to complete all the movements as quickly as possible while maintaining good form. The goal here is to build strength and endurance, particularly in the legs and upper body, while also testing our cardiovascular fitness with that 800-meter run. 

Let’s break down each component so you know exactly what to expect and how to approach it!

## Workout Components

### 1. **Squat Clean**
- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Start with your feet hip-width apart, barbell over your midfoot.
    2. Bend at the hips and knees to grip the barbell with an overhand grip, just outside your knees.
    3. Initiate the lift by pushing through your heels, extending your hips and knees simultaneously.
    4. As the bar passes your knees, pull yourself under the bar by dropping into a squat position, catching the bar on your shoulders.
    5. Stand up to finish the rep.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and back straight throughout the lift.
    - Ensure the bar stays close to your body; it should almost graze your thighs.
    - Focus on a smooth transition into the squat; don’t let the bar drift away from you.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter barbell (20/10 kg) or a PVC pipe to practice the movement.
    - If you’re still working on your squat clean, consider doing front squats or power cleans instead.

### 2. **Pull-Ups**
- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Start by hanging from the pull-up bar with your palms facing away from you, hands shoulder-width apart.
    2. Engage your shoulders and core, then pull your body up until your chin is above the bar.
    3. Lower yourself back down with control to the starting position.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Avoid swinging; keep your body straight and engage your core.
    - Focus on pulling with your back rather than just your arms.
    - Use a full range of motion—start from a dead hang and finish with your chin above the bar.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use bands for assistance or perform ring rows if pull-ups are too challenging.
    - If you’re still building strength, consider doing jumping pull-ups or negative pull-ups.

### 3. **800 Meter Run**
- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Start with a steady pace; find a rhythm that feels sustainable.
    2. Keep your arms at a 90-degree angle and swing them forward and back to help with momentum.
    3. Focus on your breathing; try to maintain a steady inhale and exhale pattern.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your head up and look ahead, not down at your feet.
    - Land softly on your feet to reduce impact and conserve energy.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If running isn’t an option, consider rowing or biking for a similar distance.
    - For those who need to scale down, reduce the distance to 600 meters.

## Loading and Rep-Modification Options
- **Sweat:** 
    - Barbell: 20/10 kg
    - Pull-Ups: Banded or Ring Rows

## Strategy Advice
- **Pacing:** Start with a steady pace on the run; it’s easy to go out too fast and burn out. 
- **Breaking Up Sets:** For the squat cleans and pull-ups, consider breaking them into smaller sets to maintain form and avoid fatigue. For example, you might do 10 squat cleans, rest, then do another 10.
- **Stay Focused:** Keep your mind in the game. Remember, it’s about quality over quantity. Focus on your form, and the speed will come!

Alright, team! Let’s get after it and crush this WOD! Remember to listen to your body, scale as needed, and most importantly, have fun!
