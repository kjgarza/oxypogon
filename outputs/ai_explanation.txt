## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality and building endurance while focusing on proper movement patterns. We have a 6-round workout that includes rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement, ensuring we’re not just going through the motions but really working on our technique and efficiency. Let’s break it down!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Setup**: Sit comfortably on the rower or ski erg, feet securely strapped in.
- **Rowing**: 
  - Start with your knees bent and arms extended, leaning slightly forward.
  - Drive through your legs, pushing back while pulling the handle towards your chest.
  - Finish with your legs straight and lean back slightly, then return to the starting position.
- **Ski Erg**: 
  - Stand tall with feet shoulder-width apart, arms extended overhead.
  - Pull down with both arms simultaneously, engaging your core and using your legs to assist.
  
#### Form Tips:
- Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement.
- For rowing, focus on a smooth, powerful leg drive followed by a strong pull with your arms.
- For the ski erg, maintain a fluid motion; avoid jerky movements.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the intensity by focusing on form rather than speed.
- You can also switch to a stationary bike or a light jog if equipment is limited.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart.
- Step up onto the box with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body.
- Bring your other foot up to meet the first on the box, then step back down one foot at a time.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your chest up and engage your core as you step.
- Use your leg muscles, not momentum, to drive up onto the box.
- Alternate the leading foot each round to ensure balanced development.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
- You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on balance and form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out, kettlebell between your feet.
- Hinge at the hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands.
- Drive through your heels, extending your hips and knees while pulling the kettlebell up to your chin, keeping your elbows high.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your back straight and chest up during the hinge.
- Ensure the kettlebell stays close to your body throughout the pull.
- Finish with your elbows above your wrists at the top of the movement.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
- If kettlebells aren’t available, you can substitute with dumbbells or perform a high pull with a barbell.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them while standing.
- Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight from head to heels.
- Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together, then lower back down.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your body rigid; avoid sagging your hips or arching your back.
- Focus on pulling with your back muscles rather than just your arms.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier or harder.
- If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows on a barbell or use a TRX.

### Strategy Advice:
- Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the rounds. It’s better to go slower and keep good form than to rush and risk injury.
- Break up the movements into manageable sets if needed, especially on the kettlebell high pulls and ring rows.
- Stay hydrated and listen to your body; if something feels off, don’t hesitate to scale back.
