## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is designed for quality, focusing on building endurance and strength through a series of movements that will get your heart rate up while also challenging your muscles. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of rowing or skiing, followed by box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement and to keep a steady pace, ensuring you’re working efficiently without sacrificing technique.

## Workout Breakdown

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - For the rower, sit with your feet secured and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and your back straight.
    - Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - Reverse the motion by extending your arms, leaning forward, and bending your knees to return to the starting position.
    - For the Ski Erg, stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grasp the handles, and pull down while engaging your core, mimicking a skiing motion.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing or skiing, consider reducing the time to 2:00 or using a lower resistance setting.
  
### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand in front of the box with feet hip-width apart.
    - Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
    - Bring the other foot up to meet the first, then step back down one foot at a time.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
    - Make sure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height or perform step-ups without weights.
  
### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out, holding the kettlebell with both hands in front of you.
    - Hinge at your hips and lower your body to grab the kettlebell, keeping your back straight.
    - Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up towards your chin, leading with your elbows.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep the kettlebell close to your body as you pull it up.
    - Avoid using your arms too much; focus on your legs and hips to generate power.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell or perform the movement with just bodyweight to focus on form.
  
### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back with your arms extended.
    - Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight from head to heels.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together, then lower back down.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body rigid and avoid sagging your hips.
    - Focus on pulling with your back, not just your arms.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier or harder; lower rings make it easier, higher rings make it harder.

### Strategy Advice

As you tackle this WOD, remember to pace yourself. It’s easy to go out too fast, especially on the rower or ski erg, but aim for a steady rhythm. Break up the box step-ups and kettlebell high pulls into manageable sets if needed, and focus on maintaining good form throughout. The ring rows can be a great place to catch your breath while still working hard, so use that to your advantage!

Let’s get after it, and remember to have fun while you’re working hard!
