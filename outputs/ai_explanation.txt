# Workout Overview
Hey everyone! Today we have an exciting WOD that combines strength and conditioning. We‚Äôll kick things off with some Back Squats to build strength, and then we‚Äôll dive into an 18-minute AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) that will really test your endurance and grit. The goal here is to focus on form during the strength segment and then push your limits in the conditioning piece while maintaining good technique. Let‚Äôs break it down!

## Strength Segment
1. **Back Squat**
   - **Technique Steps**:
     - Start by setting the barbell on your upper back, just below your neck. Make sure your grip is comfortable and your elbows are pointing down.
     - Stand tall, take a deep breath, and brace your core.
     - Initiate the squat by pushing your hips back and bending your knees. Keep your chest up and your back straight.
     - Lower yourself until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground, or lower if your mobility allows.
     - Drive through your heels to stand back up, fully extending your hips and knees at the top.
   - **Form Tips**:
     - Keep your weight in your heels and your knees tracking over your toes.
     - Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement; avoid rounding your back.
     - Don‚Äôt rush; focus on controlled movements to build strength effectively.
   - **Scaling/Modifications**:
     - If you‚Äôre new to squatting, you can use a lighter barbell or even a PVC pipe to practice the movement.
     - Consider box squats to help with depth and form if you struggle with balance.
   - **Loading**:
     - Start at 60% of your 1RM and aim to build in weight over the 7 sets. Listen to your body and adjust as needed.

## Conditioning Segment [AMRAP 18]
2. **15 Back Squats**
   - **Technique Steps**:
     - Use the same technique as the strength segment, but remember to keep your pace steady.
   - **Scaling/Modifications**:
     - Use a lighter weight or perform air squats if you need to focus on form.
  
3. **2 Wall Walks**
   - **Technique Steps**:
     - Start in a plank position with your feet against the wall.
     - Walk your feet up the wall while simultaneously walking your hands closer to the wall until your chest touches the wall.
     - Reverse the movement to return to the starting position.
   - **Form Tips**:
     - Keep your core tight to maintain a straight line from your head to your heels.
     - Move slowly and deliberately; don‚Äôt rush the movement.
   - **Scaling/Modifications**:
     - If wall walks are too challenging, try a pike push-up or a shoulder tap in a plank position.
  
4. **15 Double Dumbbell Box Step Ups (24‚Äù/20‚Äù)**
   - **Technique Steps**:
     - Hold a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.
     - Step up onto the box with one foot, driving through your heel to lift your body up.
     - Step down carefully and alternate legs.
   - **Form Tips**:
     - Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
     - Ensure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down.
   - **Scaling/Modifications**:
     - Use a lower box or perform single-leg step-ups without weights if needed.

5. **2 Wall Walks** (Repeat)
   - Same as above.

### Loading Options
- **Sweat**: 
  - Back Squats: 40/20 kg
  - Dumbbell Step Ups: 15/10 kg
  - Wall Walks: As Heavy As Possible (AHAP)
  
- **Train**: 
  - Back Squats: 50/30 kg
  - Dumbbell Step Ups: 17.5/12.5 kg
  
- **Compete**: 
  - Back Squats: 60/40 kg
  - Dumbbell Step Ups: 22.5/15 kg

### Strategy Advice
- For the conditioning piece, aim for a steady pace. It‚Äôs better to break up the sets early rather than go all out and burn out quickly.
- Focus on maintaining good form, especially during the Wall Walks and Step Ups, as fatigue sets in.
- Keep an eye on the clock and manage your energy wisely; you want to be able to keep moving for the full 18 minutes!

Alright team, let‚Äôs get warmed up and ready to crush this WOD! Remember, focus on your form, listen to your body, and most importantly, have fun! Let‚Äôs do this! üí™
