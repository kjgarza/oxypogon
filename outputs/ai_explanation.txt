## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is structured as an interval workout where we’ll be completing a series of movements every 6 minutes for a total of 6 rounds. The goal here is to build strength, improve endurance, and enhance your overall conditioning. We’ll be working on some upper body strength with handstand push-ups and strict pull-ups, while also incorporating some lower body work with double dumbbell box step overs. And of course, we’ll finish each round with a 400-meter run to get that heart rate up! 

Let’s break it down step by step so you know exactly what to expect and how to perform each movement safely and effectively.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Handstand Push-Ups

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Start in a handstand position against a wall, with your hands shoulder-width apart.
    - Lower your head towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping your body straight.
    - Press back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your core tight to maintain a straight line from your hands to your feet.
    - Avoid flaring your elbows out; keep them close to your body.
    - Use the wall for support if you’re still mastering the balance.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re not comfortable with handstand push-ups, try **Pike Push-Ups**: Start in a downward dog position and lower your head towards the ground.
    - Alternatively, you can perform **Z-Presses** seated on the ground with dumbbells.

### 2. Double Dumbbell Box Step Overs

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.
    - Step up onto the box with one foot, driving through your heel to lift your body up.
    - Step down with the same foot, then follow with the other foot to complete one rep.
    - Alternate legs with each rep.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and core engaged as you step.
    - Make sure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down.
    - Move at a steady pace to maintain control.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If the box height is too challenging, lower it to a height that feels comfortable.
    - You can also reduce the weight of the dumbbells or perform the movement without weights.

### 3. Strict Pull-Ups

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Hang from the pull-up bar with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.
    - Engage your shoulders and pull your body up until your chin is above the bar.
    - Lower yourself back down with control to the starting position.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Avoid swinging; keep your body as still as possible.
    - Focus on using your back muscles to pull yourself up, not just your arms.
    - Keep your core tight to help stabilize your body.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re not able to do strict pull-ups, use a **banded pull-up** for assistance.
    - Alternatively, you can perform **Ring Rows** to build strength.

### 4. 400 Meter Run

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Start with a light jog to warm up your legs.
    - Maintain a steady pace, focusing on your breathing.
    - Keep your arms at a 90-degree angle and swing them naturally as you run.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Land softly on your feet to reduce impact.
    - Keep your head up and look ahead, not down at your feet.
    - Relax your shoulders to avoid tension.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If running isn’t feasible, you can substitute with a **500-meter row** or **1-minute of jump rope**.

- Break up the movements if needed, especially on the strict pull-ups and handstand push-ups, to avoid fatigue.
- Keep an eye on the clock to ensure you’re ready to start each round on time!
