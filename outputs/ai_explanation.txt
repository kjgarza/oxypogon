## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality and maintaining good movement patterns while getting in some solid work. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of a mix of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to focus on your form and technique while building endurance and strength. Remember, it’s not just about getting through the rounds; it’s about doing each movement correctly and efficiently.

## Workout Components Breakdown

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - For the Row: Sit on the rower with your feet secured. Grab the handle with both hands, keeping your back straight and core engaged. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest, then return to the starting position.
    - For the Ski Erg: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grasp the handles with both hands. Engage your core and pull the handles down towards your hips while driving your arms back, then return to the starting position.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement; your arms should follow.
    - Maintain a steady rhythm; don’t rush!

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing, focus on shorter intervals (1:00) to build confidence.
    - For the Ski Erg, reduce resistance if needed to maintain form.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand in front of the box with feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box. Step down carefully and alternate legs.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and core engaged throughout the movement.
    - Make sure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down.
    - Use a controlled motion; avoid rushing through the reps.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if needed to maintain balance and control.
    - If you have knee concerns, consider doing step-ups without weights or using a bench.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Hold the kettlebell with both hands in front of you. Hinge at the hips, lowering the kettlebell between your legs. Explosively extend your hips and pull the kettlebell up to your chin, keeping your elbows high.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and chest up during the hinge.
    - Drive through your heels and engage your glutes as you stand.
    - Keep the kettlebell close to your body as you pull it up.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to the movement.
    - If kettlebells are unavailable, you can substitute with dumbbells.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back with your arms extended. Grab the rings and walk your feet forward until your body is in a straight line. Pull your chest towards the rings, keeping your elbows close to your body, then lower back down.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body straight and avoid sagging your hips.
    - Engage your core throughout the movement.
    - Focus on pulling with your back, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier or harder.
    - If rings are not available, you can use a barbell for inverted rows.

### Strategy Advice

As you tackle this WOD, remember to pace yourself. Focus on maintaining good form throughout each movement rather than rushing through the rounds. Break up the reps if you need to, especially on the kettlebell high pulls and ring rows, to keep your technique sharp. Listen to your body and adjust the intensity as needed. Let’s have fun and crush this workout together!
