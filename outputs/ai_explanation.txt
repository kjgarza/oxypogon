## Strategy Advice
- **Pacing:** With 20 rounds, itâ€™s crucial to find a sustainable pace. Donâ€™t go all out in the first few rounds; instead, aim for consistency.
- **Break It Up:** For the pull-ups and push jerks, consider breaking them into smaller sets if you start to fatigue.
- **Stay Focused:** Keep your form sharp throughout. Itâ€™s better to slow down and maintain good technique than to rush and risk injury.

Remember, this workout is all about pushing your limits while maintaining safety and form. Letâ€™s get after it and have some fun! ðŸ’ª
