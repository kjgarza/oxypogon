## Strength Segment

### 3-Position Power Snatch

**Structure:**
- Youâ€™ll perform this on a 1:45 timer for 7 sets.
- Each set consists of:
  - 1 High Hang Snatch
  - 1 Hang Snatch
  - 1 Power Snatch

**Technique Steps:**
1. **High Hang Snatch:**
   - Start with the barbell at your hips, feet shoulder-width apart.
   - Hinge slightly at the hips while keeping your chest up.
   - Explosively extend your hips and pull the barbell overhead, catching it in a quarter squat.
   - Stand tall to finish the rep.

2. **Hang Snatch:**
   - Start from the hang position (bar just above the knees).
   - Hinge at the hips, keeping your back flat and core engaged.
   - Extend your hips and pull the barbell overhead, catching it in a full squat.
   - Stand tall to complete the rep.

3. **Power Snatch:**
   - Start from the floor with your feet hip-width apart.
   - Perform a deadlift to bring the bar to your hips, then initiate the snatch.
   - Pull the barbell overhead, catching it in a partial squat.
   - Stand tall to finish.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep the bar close to your body throughout all movements.
- Focus on explosive hip extension; this is where your power comes from!
- Maintain a neutral spine and engaged core to protect your back.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- If youâ€™re new to the snatch, consider using a lighter barbell or a PVC pipe to focus on form.
- You can also perform the movement with dumbbells if that feels more comfortable.

**Loading:**
- Start at 50% of your 1RM and aim to build to 85-90% by the last set. 
- **Sweat:** 30-40% of your 1RM
- **Train:** 50-70% of your 1RM
- **Compete:** 75-90% of your 1RM

## Conditioning Segment [4 Rounds for Time]

### 12 Power Snatch + Max Calories on the Bike

**Structure:**
- Youâ€™ll work for 2 minutes, then rest for 2 minutes, repeating this for 4 rounds.

**Technique Steps for Power Snatch:**
- Start with the barbell on the ground, feet hip-width apart.
- Grip the bar just outside your knees.
- Initiate the lift by driving through your heels, extending your hips and knees simultaneously.
- Pull the barbell up and overhead, catching it in a partial squat.
- Stand tall to complete the rep.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your elbows high and the bar close to your body during the pull.
- Focus on a smooth transition from the ground to overhead; donâ€™t rush it!

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- If the barbell feels too heavy, reduce the weight or switch to dumbbells.
- For the bike, you can adjust the resistance or aim for fewer calories if youâ€™re newer to this.

**Loading Options:**
- **Sweat:** 20/10 kg for the barbell, aim for a moderate pace on the bike.
- **Train:** 30/20 kg for the barbell, push for a challenging pace.
- **Compete:** 40/30 kg for the barbell, go all out on the bike!

### Strategy Advice:
- During the power snatches, focus on maintaining a steady pace. Itâ€™s better to break up the reps into smaller sets if needed rather than going all out and burning out quickly.
- On the bike, push hard during the work intervals, but be mindful of your energy for the next round.
