We’re going to tackle 6 rounds of a mix of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement while focusing on your breathing and pacing. Let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Setup**: Adjust the damper setting on the rower or ski erg to a comfortable level (around 3-5 for most).
- **Grip**: For the rower, grip the handle with both hands, keeping your arms straight. For the ski erg, hold the handles with a neutral grip.
- **Start Position**: Sit tall with your back straight, feet secured, and knees slightly bent.
- **Movement**: 
  - For the rower: Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest. Reverse the motion smoothly.
  - For the ski erg: Engage your core, pull down with your arms while driving your knees up slightly, and return to the start position.
  
#### Form Tips:
- Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.
- Use your legs to drive the movement; your arms should follow.
  
#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or switch to a stationary bike for a similar cardio effect.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Setup**: Stand in front of a sturdy box or platform, feet hip-width apart.
- **Movement**: 
  - Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
  - Bring your other foot up to meet the first on the box, then step back down one foot at a time.
  
#### Form Tips:
- Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
- Use your arms for balance if needed.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
- Perform step-ups without weights or use a dumbbell for added resistance.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Setup**: Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out, kettlebell on the ground between your feet.
- **Movement**: 
  - Hinge at your hips and grab the kettlebell with both hands.
  - Stand up, driving through your heels, and pull the kettlebell up towards your chin, keeping your elbows high.
  - Lower the kettlebell back down to the ground and repeat.
  
#### Form Tips:
- Keep your back flat and chest up during the hinge.
- Ensure the kettlebell stays close to your body as you pull it up.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lighter kettlebell or perform the movement without weight to focus on form.
- If you’re new, you can also do a kettlebell deadlift instead of the high pull.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Setup**: Adjust the rings to a height where you can comfortably reach them while standing.
- **Movement**: 
  - Grab the rings with an overhand grip and lean back, keeping your body straight.
  - Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together, then lower back down.
  
#### Form Tips:
- Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
- Avoid letting your hips sag or your shoulders round forward.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If rings are too challenging, perform inverted rows on a bar or use a TRX strap.
- You can also do bent-over dumbbell rows if rings aren’t available.
