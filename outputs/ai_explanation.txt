## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality and consistency. We’re diving into a 6-round workout that includes a mix of cardio, strength, and bodyweight movements. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while focusing on your breathing and pacing. This workout is designed to build endurance, strength, and coordination, so let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps**:
    - For the Row: Sit with your feet strapped in, knees bent, and grab the handle. Start with your arms extended and back straight.
    - Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - Reverse the movement: extend your arms, lean forward, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.
    - For the Ski Erg: Stand tall, grip the handles, and initiate the movement by pulling down with your arms while driving your knees slightly forward.
  
- **Form Tips**:
    - Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement.
    - Focus on a smooth, controlled stroke rather than rushing through it.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the intensity by lowering the resistance or taking breaks as needed.
  
### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps**:
    - Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart.
    - Step up onto the box with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body up.
    - Bring the other foot up to meet the first on top of the box, then step back down one foot at a time.
  
- **Form Tips**:
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core to maintain balance.
    - Use your arms for momentum if needed.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps**:
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Place the kettlebell between your feet.
    - Hinge at your hips and bend your knees to grab the kettlebell with both hands.
    - Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up along your body to your chin, keeping your elbows high.
    - Lower the kettlebell back down to the ground in a controlled manner.
  
- **Form Tips**:
    - Keep your back flat and chest up during the lift.
    - Focus on using your legs to drive the movement rather than just your arms.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - You can also perform a kettlebell deadlift without the high pull if needed.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps**:
    - Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them while standing.
    - Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight from head to heels.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings by bending your elbows and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
    - Lower yourself back to the starting position in a controlled manner.
  
- **Form Tips**:
    - Keep your body straight and avoid sagging your hips.
    - Engage your core throughout the movement for stability.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier (lower for more assistance).
    - If rings are not available, you can substitute with inverted rows using a barbell.
