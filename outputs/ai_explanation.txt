## Strength Segment

### Front Squat

**Overview:**
The Front Squat is a key movement that emphasizes leg strength, core stability, and proper squat mechanics. Itâ€™s crucial to maintain good form to prevent injury and maximize effectiveness.

#### Technique Steps:
1. **Setup**: Start by placing the barbell on your front rack position. This means resting it on your shoulders with your elbows high and your hands gripping the bar.
2. **Feet Position**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out.
3. **Engage Core**: Take a deep breath, brace your core, and keep your chest up.
4. **Descent**: Initiate the squat by bending at the knees and hips simultaneously. Keep your elbows high and your torso upright as you lower down.
5. **Depth**: Aim to get your thighs parallel to the ground or lower, while keeping your heels flat on the floor.
6. **Ascent**: Push through your heels to stand back up, driving your knees out and maintaining that upright torso.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your elbows high throughout the movement to prevent the bar from rolling forward.
- Focus on keeping your weight in your heels and your chest up to maintain balance.
- Use a mirror or ask a coach for feedback on your form.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If youâ€™re new to this movement, consider using a lighter barbell or even a PVC pipe to practice the mechanics.
- You can also perform Front Squats with a kettlebell or dumbbell held in the goblet position.

#### Loading:
- **Sweat**: Start at 50-60% of your 1RM.
- **Train**: Build up to 70-80% of your 1RM.
- **Compete**: Aim for 90% of your 1RM.

## Conditioning Segment [12 Intervals on the 1:30]

### 1. Row for Calories

**Overview:**
Rowing is a great way to build aerobic capacity and engage multiple muscle groups. The goal here is to accumulate calories efficiently.

#### Technique Steps:
1. **Setup**: Sit on the rower with your feet secured in the straps.
2. **Grip**: Hold the handle with both hands, palms facing down.
3. **Drive**: Start with your legs, pushing through your heels while leaning back slightly and pulling the handle towards your chest.
4. **Recovery**: Extend your arms, lean forward, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your back straight and avoid hunching over.
- Use your legs to drive the power, not just your arms.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Adjust the damper setting on the rower to make it easier or harder.
- If rowing isnâ€™t an option, you can substitute with a bike or run.

#### Loading:

#### Scaling/Modifications:

### 3. Toes to Bar

**Overview:**
Toes to bar is a fantastic core exercise that also engages your shoulders and grip. Itâ€™s important to maintain control throughout the movement.

#### Technique Steps:
1. **Hang Position**: Start by hanging from a pull-up bar with your arms fully extended.
2. **Engage Core**: Activate your core and pull your legs up towards the bar.
3. **Lift**: As you lift your legs, aim to touch your toes to the bar while keeping your body controlled.
4. **Lower**: Slowly lower your legs back to the starting position.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your shoulders engaged and avoid swinging.
- Use a kipping motion if youâ€™re comfortable, but focus on control.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If toes to bar is too challenging, you can scale to knee raises or straight leg raises.

#### Loading:
- **Sweat**: 20 Knee / Straight Leg Raises
- **Train**: 15 Toes to Bar
- **Compete**: 20 Toes to Bar

## Strategy Advice

- **Pacing**: For the rowing, find a steady pace that you can maintain throughout the intervals. Donâ€™t go all out on the first round; save some energy for the later rounds.
- **Breaking Up Sets**: For the front squats, consider breaking them into smaller sets if needed (e.g., 8-7 or 5-5-5) to maintain form.
- **Core Control**: On the toes to bar, focus on controlled movements rather than speed to avoid swinging.
