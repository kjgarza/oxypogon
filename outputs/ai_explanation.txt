## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality and consistency. We’ll be tackling 6 rounds of a mix of cardio and strength movements designed to build endurance, strength, and coordination. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while pushing yourself to stay efficient. Let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - **Rowing:** Sit with your feet secured in the foot straps, grab the handle, and start with your knees bent and back straight. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - **Ski Erg:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grip the handles, and initiate the movement by bending your knees slightly. Pull down with your arms while driving your knees forward, mimicking a skiing motion.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your core engaged to protect your back.
    - In rowing, focus on a smooth, powerful leg drive followed by the pull.
    - In the Ski Erg, maintain a fluid motion, using your legs and arms together.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing, reduce the time to 2:00 or focus on technique rather than speed.
    - For the Ski Erg, you can also perform a modified version using a resistance band for upper body pulls.

### 2. Box Step-ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box. Bring the other foot up to meet the first, then step back down one foot at a time.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
    - Use your arms for balance; they can help propel you upward.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re unsure about your balance or strength.
    - You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Place the kettlebell between your feet. Hinge at your hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands. Stand up, pulling the kettlebell up along your body, leading with your elbows until it reaches chest height.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and engage your glutes as you lift.
    - Ensure the kettlebell stays close to your body throughout the movement.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - If kettlebells aren’t available, you can substitute with dumbbells or perform a bodyweight squat.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back with your arms extended. Grab the rings and walk your feet forward until your body is at an angle. Pull your chest towards the rings, keeping your body straight, and then lower back down.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your core tight and avoid sagging your hips.
    - Focus on pulling with your back and arms, not just your shoulders.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If ring rows are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows on a bar or use a band for assistance.
    - Alternatively, you can do bent-over dumbbell rows.

## Loading and Rep-Modification Options

- **Sweat:** 
    - Use a lighter kettlebell (16/8 kg) and focus on form over speed.
  
- **Train:** 
    - Use a moderate kettlebell (20/12 kg) and aim for steady pacing throughout the rounds.

- **Compete:** 
    - Use a heavier kettlebell (24/16 kg) and push for intensity while maintaining quality.

### Strategy Advice

- **Pacing:** Start each round strong but be mindful of your energy. It’s better to maintain a steady pace than to burn out early.
- **Breaks:** Don’t hesitate to take short breaks between movements if you need to. Quality over quantity is key here!
- **Focus on Form:** Remember, the goal is quality. Keep your movements controlled and precise, especially as you start to fatigue.

Alright team, let’s get after it! Remember to listen to your body and have fun with it!
