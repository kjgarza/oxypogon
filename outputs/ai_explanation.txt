### Part 1: Hang Power Snatch

**What You‚Äôll Do:**
- You‚Äôll be doing 3 Hang Power Snatches every 1:45 for a total of 7 rounds. 

**How to Perform a Hang Power Snatch:**
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, barbell (or dumbbell) in front of you.
   - Grip the barbell with your hands just outside your knees. If using a dumbbell, hold it vertically with one hand on each end.

2. **Set Up:**
   - Bend your knees slightly and hinge at your hips, keeping your back straight and chest up. Your shoulders should be slightly in front of the bar.
   - Engage your core and keep your weight on your heels.

3. **The Hang:**
   - From this position, you‚Äôll want to lift the barbell just above your knees (this is the ‚Äúhang‚Äù position). 

4. **The Pull:**
   - In one explosive motion, extend your hips and knees while pulling the barbell up. Think of it as jumping straight up while keeping the bar close to your body.

5. **The Catch:**
   - As the barbell rises, drop under it by bending your knees and catching it overhead with your arms fully extended. Your feet should be in a stable position, about shoulder-width apart.

6. **Stand Up:**
   - Stand tall with the barbell locked out overhead, making sure your core is engaged and your shoulders are active.

7. **Lowering the Bar:**
   - Bring the barbell back down to the hang position in a controlled manner, ready to go for your next rep.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep the bar close to your body throughout the movement.
- Make sure your elbows are high when you catch the bar overhead.
- Don‚Äôt forget to breathe! Inhale as you lower the bar and exhale as you lift.

**Scaling Options:**
- If you‚Äôre new to this movement, you can start with a lighter weight or even a PVC pipe to practice your form.
- If you find the full snatch challenging, you can do a Hang Power Clean instead, which is a bit easier to catch.

### Part 2: Conditioning

**For Time:**
- You‚Äôll be doing 100 Alternating Dumbbell Hang Snatches, 100 V-ups, and 100 Single Dumbbell Reverse Lunges. 

**1. Alternating Dumbbell Hang Snatches:**
- Just like the barbell version, but with a dumbbell. Start in the hang position, and alternate hands with each rep. 

**2. V-ups:**
- **How to Perform:**
  1. Lie flat on your back with your arms extended overhead and legs straight.
  2. Simultaneously lift your legs and upper body off the ground, reaching your hands towards your feet to form a ‚ÄúV‚Äù shape.
  3. Lower back down with control and repeat.

- **Scaling Options:**
  - If V-ups are too challenging, try Tuck Ups: bend your knees and bring them towards your chest while reaching for your shins.

**3. Single Dumbbell Reverse Lunges:**
- Hold a dumbbell in one hand at your side.
- Step back with one leg into a lunge, keeping your front knee over your ankle.
- Push through your front heel to return to standing, then switch hands and repeat on the other side.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your core engaged during all movements to protect your back.
- For lunges, ensure your back knee nearly touches the ground for a full range of motion.

**Scaling Options:**
- If lunges are tough, you can do them without weights or switch to step-ups on a box.
