## Workout Overview

Hey team! Today’s WOD is all about quality movement and building endurance. We’ll be going through 6 rounds of a mix of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to focus on form and technique while keeping a steady pace. This workout is designed to challenge your cardiovascular endurance, lower body strength, and upper body pulling mechanics. Let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - **Rowing:** Sit with your feet strapped in, knees bent, and back straight. Grab the handle with both hands, arms extended. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest, then return to the starting position.
    - **Ski Erg:** Stand tall with feet shoulder-width apart, grasp the handles with both hands. Engage your core, and pull the handles down towards your hips while driving your elbows back, then return to the starting position.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and avoid hunching over.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement; your arms should follow.
    - Maintain a steady rhythm; don’t rush!

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or 1:30.
    - Focus on technique rather than speed; it’s okay to go slower to maintain form.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box. Step back down and switch legs.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core.
    - Use a full foot on the box to ensure stability.
    - Avoid leaning forward; keep your weight centered.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - If you have knee issues, consider stepping onto a sturdy platform or doing step-ups without weights.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Hold the kettlebell with both hands between your legs. Hinge at the hips to lower the kettlebell, then explosively extend your hips and pull the kettlebell up to your chin, keeping your elbows high.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and core engaged throughout the movement.
    - Drive through your heels as you stand up.
    - Keep the kettlebell close to your body during the pull.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - If kettlebells are not available, you can substitute with dumbbells or do a bodyweight squat.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to pull your body up to them. Grab the rings with an overhand grip, lean back, and keep your body straight. Pull your chest to the rings, then lower back down.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
    - Engage your lats and core as you pull.
    - Avoid using momentum; focus on controlled movements.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If rings are too challenging, you can use a barbell set at waist height for inverted rows.
    - Adjust the angle of your body to make it easier or harder.

### Strategy Advice

- Break up the reps if needed, especially on the kettlebell high pulls and ring rows, to maintain quality.
- Stay hydrated and listen to your body; if something feels off, don’t hesitate to scale back.
