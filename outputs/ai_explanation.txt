## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s workout is all about quality and consistency. We’ll be doing **6 rounds** of a mix of cardio and strength movements, which will help improve your endurance, coordination, and overall strength. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while keeping a steady pace. Remember, it’s not just about getting through the reps; it’s about doing them well!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

**Technique Steps:**
- **Rowing:**
  - Start seated on the rower with your feet secured in the foot straps.
  - Grip the handle with both hands, keeping your arms straight and your back tall.
  - Push through your legs, lean back slightly at the hips, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.
  - Reverse the movement by extending your arms, leaning forward, and bending your knees.
  
- **Ski Erg:**
  - Stand tall with feet shoulder-width apart, gripping the handles.
  - Engage your core and pull the handles down towards your hips while driving your knees slightly forward.
  - Return to the starting position with control, maintaining a steady rhythm.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.
- Use your legs to generate power, not just your arms.
- Maintain a consistent pace throughout the 3 minutes.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- If you’re new to rowing, aim for a lower intensity or shorter duration (e.g., 2 minutes).
- For Ski Erg, reduce the resistance or switch to a rower if needed.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

**Technique Steps:**
- Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart.
- Step up onto the box with one foot, driving through your heel to lift your body up.
- Bring the other foot up to meet the first on the box, then step back down one foot at a time.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
- Ensure your entire foot is on the box to avoid slipping.
- Alternate the leading foot each round to balance the workload.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
- If you have knee issues, consider doing step-ups without weights or using a bench.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

**Technique Steps:**
- Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out.
- Place the kettlebell between your feet and hinge at the hips to grab it with both hands.
- Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up towards your chin while keeping your elbows high.
- Lower the kettlebell back down with control.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your back flat and engage your core during the lift.
- Focus on using your legs to initiate the movement, not just your arms.
- Ensure the kettlebell stays close to your body as you pull it up.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
- If kettlebells are not available, you can substitute with dumbbells or perform a sumo deadlift without the high pull.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

**Technique Steps:**
- Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back comfortably.
- Grab the rings with an overhand grip and walk your feet forward until your body is at an angle.
- Pull your chest towards the rings by bending your elbows and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
- Lower yourself back down with control.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your body straight from head to heels; avoid sagging your hips.
- Focus on pulling with your back, not just your arms.
- Adjust your foot position to increase or decrease the difficulty.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows on a barbell or use a TRX.
- For beginners, elevate your feet or use a lower angle to make it easier.

- Stay hydrated and listen to your body. If you feel fatigued, take a moment to breathe and reset before continuing.
