## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality movement and building endurance. We’ll be tackling six rounds of rowing or skiing, followed by some box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement while focusing on your breathing and pacing. Let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - **Rowing:** Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and your back straight. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest.
    - **Ski Erg:** Stand tall, grab the handles, and start with your arms extended. Pull down with your arms while bending your knees slightly, engaging your core as you drive your elbows back.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and core engaged to avoid rounding your spine.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.
    - For the Ski Erg, focus on a smooth, controlled pull rather than yanking the handles.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you're new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or even 1:30 to focus on technique.
    - You can also switch to a stationary bike if available.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand in front of the box with your feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
    - Bring your other foot up to meet the first, then step back down one foot at a time.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
    - Ensure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down to maintain balance.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re unsure about your balance or strength.
    - If you have knee issues, consider doing step-ups without weights or performing a seated leg extension instead.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out. Place the kettlebell between your feet.
    - Hinge at your hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands. Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up to your chin, keeping your elbows high.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and core tight during the hinge.
    - Use your legs to initiate the movement, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - If kettlebells are not available, you can substitute with dumbbell high pulls.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to pull yourself up comfortably. Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings while keeping your elbows close to your body, then lower yourself back down.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body straight from head to heels; avoid sagging your hips.
    - Engage your core and squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If ring rows are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows using a barbell or a sturdy table.
    - Alternatively, you can do banded rows with a resistance band.
