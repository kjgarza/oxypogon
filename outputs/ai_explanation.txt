## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is a fantastic blend of strength and conditioning that will really challenge your power and endurance. We’ll kick things off with a strength segment focusing on the Hang Clean and Jerk, where we’ll work on our technique and build up to a heavier weight. Then, we’ll dive into a conditioning piece that combines Hang Power Cleans and Shoulder to Overhead with some hill runs to really get that heart rate up. The goal here is to improve your strength while also pushing your cardiovascular limits. Let’s break it down!

## Strength Segment

### Hang Clean and Jerk (Barbell)

- **Technique Steps:**
    1. **Setup**: Start with the barbell on the ground. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, and grip the bar just outside your knees.
    2. **Hang Position**: Hinge at your hips and knees, lowering the bar to just above your knees. Keep your back flat and chest up.
    3. **The Clean**: Explode through your legs, extending your hips and knees while pulling the bar up. As the bar reaches your hips, drop under it into a squat position, catching it on your shoulders.
    4. **The Jerk**: Stand up from the squat, then dip slightly at the knees and drive the bar overhead, locking out your arms. 
    5. **Reset**: Lower the bar back to your shoulders, then back to the hang position to repeat.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep the bar close to your body throughout the movement.
    - Ensure your elbows are high when catching the bar on your shoulders.
    - Drive through your legs during the jerk, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to this movement, consider using a lighter barbell or even a PVC pipe to focus on form.
    - You can also break the movement into two parts: practice Hang Power Cleans and Shoulder to Overhead separately.

- **Loading:**
    - Start at 50% of your 1RM for the first set and gradually build up to 80-85% by the last set. This progressive loading helps you focus on technique while also preparing your body for heavier lifts.

## Conditioning Segment [For Time]

### 5-10-15-20 Reps of:

1. **Hang Power Cleans**
    - **Technique Steps:**
        1. Start in the same hang position as before.
        2. Hinge at your hips, then explosively pull the bar up, catching it in a quarter squat.
        3. Stand tall to finish the rep.
    - **Form Tips:**
        - Keep your elbows high and the bar close to your body.
        - Use your legs to drive the bar up, not just your arms.
    - **Scaling/Modifications:**
        - Use a lighter barbell or dumbbells if needed.
        - Reduce the number of reps if you’re still mastering the movement.

2. **Hill Run**
    - **Technique Steps:**
        1. Start with a strong, steady pace as you approach the hill.
        2. Maintain an upright posture and drive your knees up as you run.
        3. Focus on your breathing and keep a consistent rhythm.
    - **Form Tips:**
        - Use your arms to help drive your legs; they should move in sync.
        - Shorten your stride slightly to maintain speed and control on the incline.
    - **Scaling/Modifications:**
        - If running isn’t an option, consider a brisk walk or a rowing machine for a similar cardio effect.

3. **Shoulder to Overhead**
    - **Technique Steps:**
        1. Start with the barbell at your shoulders.
        2. Dip slightly at the knees, then drive the bar overhead, locking out your arms.
        3. Lower the bar back to your shoulders to repeat.
    - **Form Tips:**
        - Keep your core tight to stabilize your body.
        - Ensure your elbows are locked out at the top of the movement.
    - **Scaling/Modifications:**
        - Use a lighter barbell or dumbbells if needed.
        - You can also perform Push Presses instead of a full Shoulder to Overhead if you’re still building strength.

### Loading Options:

- **Sweat**: 30/20 kg DB, focus on form and technique.
- **Train**: 45/30 kg DB, challenge yourself but maintain good form.
- **Compete**: 60/40 kg DB, push your limits, but listen to your body.

### Strategy Advice:

- For the conditioning piece, aim for a steady pace. It’s better to break up the Hang Power Cleans and Shoulder to Overhead into manageable sets rather than going all out and burning out early.
- Keep your transitions smooth, especially between the lifts and the hill runs. This will help maintain your heart rate and keep you moving efficiently throughout the workout.

Alright, team! Let’s get after it, focus on our form, and have some fun! Remember, it’s all about progress, so listen to your body and enjoy the workout!
