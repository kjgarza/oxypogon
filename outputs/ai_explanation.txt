## Strength Segment

### Barbell Floor Press

**Overview**: The Barbell Floor Press is a great way to build upper body strength while minimizing shoulder strain. It allows you to focus on pressing strength without the need for a full range of motion, which can be beneficial for those with shoulder issues.

#### Technique Steps:
1. **Setup**: Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat. Position the barbell over your chest, gripping it slightly wider than shoulder-width.
2. **Starting Position**: Keep your elbows on the floor and your wrists straight. Your arms should be perpendicular to the floor.
3. **Press**: Engage your core, press the barbell up until your arms are fully extended. Focus on squeezing your chest at the top.
4. **Lower**: Slowly lower the barbell back down until your elbows touch the floor, maintaining control throughout the movement.
5. **Repeat**: Reset and repeat for the prescribed reps.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your shoulder blades retracted and your back flat against the floor.
- Avoid flaring your elbows out too much; they should be at about a 45-degree angle from your body.
- Focus on a controlled tempo to maximize muscle engagement.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If youâ€™re new to this movement, you can start with a lighter barbell or even a pair of dumbbells.
- If you have limited range of motion, consider doing a floor press with a resistance band instead.

#### Loading Options:
- **Sweat**: Use a light barbell (20-30% of your body weight) or dumbbells.
- **Train**: Moderate loading (50-70% of your 1RM).
- **Compete**: Heavier loading (75-85% of your 1RM), focusing on maintaining perfect form.

## Conditioning Segment [For Time]

### 18 x 45 Seconds On / 15 Seconds Off

This conditioning piece is all about maximizing your effort in short bursts. Youâ€™ll alternate between Wall Walks and Ski Erg, which will challenge your strength and aerobic capacity.

#### Interval 1: Max Wall Walks

**Overview**: Wall Walks are a fantastic way to build shoulder strength and stability while also engaging your core.

##### Technique Steps:
1. **Start Position**: Begin in a plank position with your feet against the wall.
2. **Walk Up**: Slowly walk your feet up the wall while simultaneously walking your hands closer to the wall. Aim to get your chest as close to the wall as possible.
3. **Hold**: At the top position, hold for a moment, engaging your core and keeping your body straight.
4. **Walk Down**: Reverse the movement, walking your hands back out and your feet down.

##### Form Tips:
- Keep your core tight throughout the movement to prevent sagging in your lower back.
- Focus on controlled movements; donâ€™t rush through the wall walks.
- If you feel unstable, take your time and donâ€™t push too hard.

##### Scaling/Modifications:
- If Wall Walks are too challenging, you can perform an elevated push-up against the wall instead.
- Alternatively, practice shoulder taps in a plank position to build strength.

#### Interval 2: Max Calories Ski Erg

**Overview**: The Ski Erg is a great way to get your heart rate up and work on your endurance.

##### Technique Steps:
1. **Setup**: Sit on the Ski Erg with your feet secured and hands on the handles.
2. **Start Pulling**: Engage your core and pull the handles down towards your hips, using your legs and arms in a coordinated motion.
3. **Return**: Allow the handles to return to the starting position while maintaining a steady rhythm.
4. **Maximize Output**: Focus on generating power from your legs and maintaining a strong pull with your arms.

##### Form Tips:
- Keep your back straight and avoid leaning too far forward or backward.
- Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.

##### Scaling/Modifications:
- If you donâ€™t have access to a Ski Erg, you can substitute with a rowing machine or even burpees for a similar cardio effect.

### Loading Options:
- **Sweat**: Focus on form and technique; aim for a moderate pace.
- **Train**: Push for a higher intensity; try to maximize calories in the time frame.
- **Compete**: Go all out! Aim for maximum effort in each interval.

### Strategy Advice:
- During the Wall Walks, pace yourself; itâ€™s easy to burn out quickly. Focus on quality over quantity.
- For the Ski Erg, find a rhythm that allows you to maintain a steady output without burning out too early.
