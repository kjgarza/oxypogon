## Strength Segment: Power Clean
1. **Power Clean**
   - **Technique Steps**:
     - Start with your feet hip-width apart, barbell over the midfoot.
     - Grip the bar just outside your knees, with a hook grip (thumbs wrapped around the bar).
     - Set your back by engaging your lats and keeping your chest up.
     - Initiate the lift by driving through your heels, extending your hips and knees simultaneously.
     - As the bar passes your knees, pull yourself under the bar, rotating your elbows around and catching it on your shoulders in a quarter squat.
     - Stand tall to finish the lift.
   - **Form Tips**:
     - Keep the bar close to your body throughout the lift.
     - Focus on a strong hip extension; this is where your power comes from!
     - Ensure your elbows are high and in front of the bar when you catch it.
   - **Scaling/Modifications**:
     - If youâ€™re new to this movement, start with a PVC pipe or a lighter barbell to focus on form.
     - You can also practice the movement with dumbbells if a barbell isnâ€™t available.
   - **Loading**:
     - Start at 45-55% of your 1RM and gradually build up to 80-85% over the six sets. Listen to your body and prioritize form over weight.

## Conditioning Segment: 20 Rounds for Time
Now, letâ€™s get into the conditioning part! This is going to be a grind, but itâ€™s all about pacing and maintaining good form throughout.

1. **2 Power Cleans**
   - **Technique Steps**:
     - Same as above! Remember to focus on your form, especially as you get tired.
   - **Scaling**: 
     - Use a lighter weight or perform the movement with dumbbells if needed.

2. **4 Toes to Bar**
   - **Technique Steps**:
     - Hang from the pull-up bar with a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width.
     - Engage your core and initiate the movement by bringing your knees up towards your chest.
     - As your knees rise, extend your legs and reach your toes towards the bar.
     - Control the descent back to the starting position.
   - **Form Tips**:
     - Keep your shoulders engaged and avoid swinging too much.
     - Focus on using your core to lift your legs rather than just momentum.
   - **Scaling/Modifications**:
     - If you canâ€™t reach the bar yet, try Knee Raises or Straight Leg Raises instead.
     - You can also perform Hanging Leg Raises if youâ€™re comfortable with that.
  
3. **20 Double Unders**
   - **Technique Steps**:
     - Start with the jump rope behind your heels.
     - Jump slightly higher than a single under, and flick your wrists to spin the rope twice before landing.
     - Keep your elbows close to your sides and use your wrists to control the rope.
   - **Form Tips**:
     - Stay relaxed and donâ€™t overthink it; focus on timing your jumps with the rope.
     - If you feel fatigued, itâ€™s okay to switch to single unders.
   - **Scaling/Modifications**:
     - If youâ€™re still mastering double unders, do 40 Single Unders instead.

## Strategy Advice
- **Pacing**: With 20 rounds, itâ€™s crucial to find a sustainable pace. Donâ€™t go all out in the first few rounds; instead, aim for consistency.
- **Break it Up**: If you find yourself getting fatigued, break up the Power Cleans into smaller sets (like 1+1) and take short rests.
- **Transitions**: Keep your transitions quick between movements to maintain your heart rate and keep the workout flowing.

Remember, focus on your form, listen to your body, and most importantly, have fun with it! Letâ€™s crush this WOD together! ðŸ’ª
