## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality and consistency. We’re diving into a 6-round workout that combines some cardio, strength, and bodyweight movements. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while focusing on your breathing and pacing. This workout is designed to build endurance and strength, so let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - **Rowing:** Sit on the rower with your feet secured. Grab the handle and start with your knees bent, back straight, and arms extended. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest.
    - **Ski Erg:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grab the handles, and start with your arms extended. Engage your core and pull the handles down while driving your knees slightly forward, using your legs to assist.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.
    - Maintain a steady rhythm; don’t rush through it.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or even 1:30 to focus on form.
    - Consider switching to a stationary bike if available.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, driving through your heel, and bring the other foot up to meet it on the box.
    - Step back down one foot at a time, ensuring you control your descent.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core.
    - Use your legs to lift, not your back.
    - Ensure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if needed (e.g., 12 inches instead of 20).
    - If you have knee issues, consider stepping up to a sturdy platform or doing seated leg lifts instead.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Place the kettlebell between your feet.
    - Hinge at the hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands. Stand up, pulling the kettlebell up along your body, leading with your elbows.
    - As the kettlebell reaches chest height, lower it back down to the start position.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and chest up during the lift.
    - Drive through your heels and engage your glutes.
    - Keep the kettlebell close to your body throughout the movement.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - If kettlebells are unavailable, you can use dumbbells or perform a bodyweight squat instead.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to pull yourself up comfortably. Grab the rings with an overhand grip and lean back, keeping your body straight.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings while keeping your elbows close to your body. Lower yourself back down with control.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Engage your core to maintain a straight line from head to heels.
    - Avoid swinging; focus on controlled movements.
    - Keep your shoulders down and away from your ears.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If rings are too challenging, use a barbell set at waist height for inverted rows.
    - For beginners, you can perform bent-over rows with a dumbbell or resistance band.

### Strategy Advice

- Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the rounds. It’s better to go slower and keep good form than to rush and risk injury.
- Break the movements into manageable sets if needed, especially on the kettlebell high pulls and box step-ups.
- Remember to breathe! Use your breath to help you power through each movement and recover between rounds.

Alright team, let’s get after it! Keep your form sharp, listen to your body, and most importantly, have fun!
