## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality and maintaining good movement patterns. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of a mix of cardio, strength, and bodyweight movements. The goal here is to focus on form and control, ensuring that we’re not just rushing through the reps but really engaging with each movement. This workout will help build endurance, strength, and coordination, so let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - For the Row: Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and your body leaning slightly forward. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - For the Ski Erg: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, grab the handles, and start with your arms extended. Pull down with your arms while bending your knees slightly, engaging your core as you drive down.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement.
    - In the row, focus on driving with your legs first, then pulling with your arms.
    - In the ski erg, think about using your whole body, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the intensity by going at a slower pace or taking breaks as needed.
    - You can also substitute with a light jog or brisk walk if equipment is limited.

### 2. Box Step-ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand in front of the box with your feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box. Bring your other foot up to meet it, then step back down one foot at a time.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and shoulders back as you step up.
    - Make sure your entire foot is on the box to avoid any slips.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on balance and form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out. Hold the kettlebell with both hands in front of you. Hinge at your hips and lower the kettlebell to the ground, keeping your back straight. Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up to your chin with elbows high.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep the kettlebell close to your body throughout the movement.
    - Engage your core and avoid rounding your back.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - If kettlebells are unavailable, you can substitute with dumbbell high pulls.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back with your arms extended. Grab the rings and walk your feet forward until your body is at an angle. Pull your chest towards the rings, keeping your body straight and core engaged, then lower back down.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your elbows close to your body as you pull.
    - Avoid letting your hips sag; maintain a straight line from head to heels.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows using a barbell or a sturdy table.
    - Alternatively, you can do bent-over rows with a dumbbell.

## Loading and Rep-Modification Options

- **Sweat:** 
    - Use 16/8 kg kettlebells for the high pulls, and focus on form over speed. Aim for a steady pace throughout the workout.

- **Train:** 
    - Use 20/12 kg kettlebells. This is a good balance of challenge and maintaining quality movement. Break up the reps if needed to maintain form.

- **Compete:** 
    - Use 24/16 kg kettlebells. Push yourself, but remember that quality comes first. If you find yourself losing form, consider scaling back.

### Strategy Advice

As you move through the rounds, focus on maintaining a steady pace rather than sprinting through. It’s better to break up the sets into manageable chunks to keep your form intact. Remember, this workout is about quality, so listen to your body and adjust as needed. Let’s have fun and get after it!
