## Workout Overview

Hey team! Today’s WOD is all about quality and control. We’re going to work through 6 rounds of a mix of cardio, strength, and bodyweight movements. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while focusing on your breathing and pacing. This workout will help improve your endurance, strength, and overall movement efficiency. Let’s break it down!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - For the rower: Sit tall with your feet secured, grab the handle, and start with your arms extended. 
    - Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - Reverse the motion: extend your arms, hinge at the hips, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.
    - For the Ski Erg: Stand tall, hold the handles, and use a similar push-pull motion, driving your arms down while engaging your core and legs.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and core engaged to avoid rounding your spine.
    - Focus on driving with your legs first, then pulling with your arms.
    - Maintain a steady rhythm; don’t rush!

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or even 1:30 to focus on form.
    - Consider using a lighter resistance setting if available.

### 2. Box Step-ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart.
    - Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
    - Bring your other foot up to meet the first, then step back down one foot at a time.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and core tight throughout the movement.
    - Ensure your entire foot is on the box to avoid slipping.
    - Alternate legs with each rep to maintain balance.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - If stepping up is challenging, you can perform step-ups without weights or do box squats instead.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out, kettlebell between your feet.
    - Hinge at the hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands.
    - Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up along your body to your chin, elbows high.
    - Lower the kettlebell back down to the starting position.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and chest up during the lift.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.
    - Control the kettlebell on the way down to maintain good form.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell or perform the movement without weight to focus on technique.
    - If kettlebells are not available, you can substitute with dumbbells.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them while standing.
    - Grab the rings with an overhand grip, lean back, and keep your body straight.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together, then lower back down.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels; avoid sagging your hips.
    - Engage your core throughout the movement.
    - Focus on a controlled tempo, especially on the way down.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows on a bar or use a TRX.
    - Adjust the angle of your body to make it easier or harder.

### Strategy Advice

- Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the rounds. It’s better to go slower and keep your form than to rush and risk injury.
- Break up the movements if needed, especially on the kettlebell high pulls and ring rows, to maintain quality.
- Remember to breathe! Use your breath to help you through each movement and keep your heart rate manageable.
