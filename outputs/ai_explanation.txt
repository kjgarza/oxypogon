## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality over quantity, focusing on building endurance and strength through a series of movements that will challenge your cardiovascular system and muscular endurance. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form and control throughout each movement while keeping a steady pace. Let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - For the Row: Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle with both hands. Start with your knees bent and your back straight. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - For the Ski Erg: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grip the handles, and engage your core. Pull down with your arms while driving your knees slightly forward, using your legs to assist the movement.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement; your arms should follow.
    - Maintain a consistent rhythm—don’t rush!

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or even 1:30 to focus on form.
    - Alternatively, you can substitute with a stationary bike or a light jog if equipment is limited.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box. Bring the other foot up to meet it, then step back down one foot at a time.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and core engaged throughout the movement.
    - Drive through your heel to activate your glutes and hamstrings.
    - Alternate legs each round to ensure balanced muscle engagement.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re new to step-ups or need to reduce the intensity.
    - If you have knee issues, consider doing step-ups without weights or performing a seated leg extension instead.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Place the kettlebell between your feet. Hinge at the hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands. Stand up, driving through your heels, and as you reach the top, pull the kettlebell up towards your chin, keeping your elbows high.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and chest up during the hinge.
    - Use your legs to initiate the movement; your arms should follow.
    - Avoid rounding your back; maintain a neutral spine.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell or perform a standard deadlift if you’re not comfortable with the high pull.
    - If kettlebells aren’t available, you can use dumbbells in a similar manner.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to pull yourself up comfortably. Grab the rings with an overhand grip, lean back, and keep your body straight. Pull your chest towards the rings while keeping your elbows close to your body.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Engage your core to maintain a straight line from head to heels.
    - Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together as you pull.
    - Avoid using momentum; control the movement both up and down.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If ring rows are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows using a barbell or a sturdy table.
    - Alternatively, you can do bent-over dumbbell rows for a similar effect.

### Strategy Advice

- Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the workout. It’s better to go slower and keep good form than to rush and risk injury.
- Break the movements into manageable sets if needed, especially on the kettlebell high pulls and ring rows.
- Stay hydrated and listen to your body—if something feels off, don’t hesitate to scale back or modify.
