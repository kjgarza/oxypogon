## Workout Components

### 1. Double Unders (80 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Start with the jump rope behind your heels.
    - Grip the handles firmly but not too tight, keeping your elbows close to your sides.
    - Jump slightly higher than a regular jump, and flick your wrists to spin the rope twice under your feet before landing.
    - Keep your body straight and land softly on the balls of your feet.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Focus on using your wrists to control the rope, not your arms.
    - Keep your jumps low and quick; you donâ€™t need to jump too high.
    - Maintain a steady rhythm; practice makes perfect!

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If youâ€™re new to double unders, switch to 160 Single Unders.
    - Use a lighter rope or practice with a partnerâ€™s rope to find the right length.

### 2. Sit-Ups (40 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.
    - Place your hands behind your head or crossed over your chest.
    - Engage your core and lift your upper body towards your knees, keeping your feet planted.
    - Lower back down with control, ensuring your shoulder blades touch the ground.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Avoid pulling on your neck; keep your elbows wide.
    - Focus on using your core to lift, not momentum.
    - Keep your feet anchored to the ground for stability.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If full sit-ups are challenging, try Ab Mat Sit-Ups or even Crunches.
    - You can also perform them with your feet elevated on a bench for a different angle.

### 3. Alternating D-Ball Box Step Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Start with a D-Ball at your chest or on your shoulder.
    - Step up onto the box with one foot, driving through your heel.
    - Bring your other foot up to meet the first on top of the box, then step back down one foot at a time.
    - Alternate legs with each rep.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and core engaged throughout the movement.
    - Use a box height that challenges you but allows for safe stepping.
    - Ensure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter D-Ball or a lower box if needed.
    - If you donâ€™t have a D-Ball, you can use a kettlebell or dumbbell.

### 4. Ring Dips (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Start by gripping the rings with your palms facing inward and arms fully extended.
    - Lower your body by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides.
    - Go down until your upper arms are parallel to the ground, then push back up to the starting position.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body straight and avoid swinging.
    - Engage your shoulders and core to maintain stability.
    - If you feel shaky, focus on controlled movements rather than speed.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a band for assistance or perform Box Dips if rings are too challenging.
    - You can also do bench dips as an alternative.

### 5. Double Dumbbell Farmers Carry (1 round)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand tall with a dumbbell in each hand, arms at your sides.
    - Engage your core and keep your shoulders back.
    - Walk forward for a set distance or time, maintaining a strong posture.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your head up and look straight ahead.
    - Avoid leaning to one side; distribute the weight evenly.
    - Take small, controlled steps to maintain balance.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use lighter dumbbells if needed or perform a single-arm carry.
    - If you donâ€™t have dumbbells, you can use kettlebells or any weighted object.
