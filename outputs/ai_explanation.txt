## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality over quantity, focusing on building endurance and strength through a series of movements that will challenge your cardiovascular system and muscular endurance. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement while keeping a steady pace. Let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - For the rower, sit with your feet secured and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and your back straight.
    - Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - Reverse the motion by extending your arms, leaning forward, and bending your knees to return to the starting position.
    - For the Ski Erg, stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grasp the handles, and pull down in a smooth motion, engaging your core and legs.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and avoid hunching over.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement; your arms should follow.
    - Maintain a steady rhythm; don’t rush!

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing, focus on shorter intervals (1:00 or 2:00) or switch to a stationary bike for a similar cardio effect.
    - For the Ski Erg, reduce the time to 2:00 if needed.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with your feet hip-width apart.
    - Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
    - Bring your other foot up to meet the first, then step back down one foot at a time.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
    - Ensure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down.
    - Alternate legs for each rep to balance the workload.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - Perform step-ups without weights to focus on form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Place the kettlebell between your feet.
    - Hinge at your hips and bend your knees to grab the kettlebell with both hands.
    - Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up along your body to your chin, elbows high.
    - Lower the kettlebell back down to the ground and repeat.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and chest up during the lift.
    - Use your legs to initiate the movement, not just your arms.
    - Control the kettlebell on the way down to avoid injury.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell or perform the movement with a dumbbell.
    - If you’re new, practice the movement without weight to master the technique.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them while standing.
    - Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight and heels on the ground.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together, then lower yourself back down.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
    - Avoid using momentum; focus on controlled movements.
    - Engage your core throughout the exercise.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier or harder.
    - If rings are too challenging, perform inverted rows on a barbell or use a TRX strap.

### Strategy Advice

As you tackle this WOD, remember to focus on maintaining good form throughout each movement. It’s better to go slower and do it right than to rush and risk injury. Break up the sets if you need to, especially on the kettlebell high pulls and ring rows, to maintain quality. Keep a steady pace, and enjoy the challenge! Let’s crush this workout together! 💪
