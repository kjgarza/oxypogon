### Breakdown of Each Component

#### 1. **400m Run**

- **Technique Steps**:
    - Start with a light jog to warm up your muscles.
    - Maintain an upright posture with your head up and shoulders relaxed.
    - Use a mid-foot strike to absorb impact and push off efficiently.
    - Keep your arms at a 90-degree angle, swinging them forward and back to help with momentum.

- **Form Tips**:
    - Breathe steadily; don‚Äôt hold your breath.
    - Focus on a consistent pace rather than sprinting all out.

- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - If running is challenging, consider a brisk walk or a 500m row as an alternative.

#### 2. **30 Burpees**

- **Technique Steps**:
    - Start standing tall, then drop into a squat position with your hands on the ground.
    - Kick your feet back into a plank position, ensuring your body is straight.
    - Perform a push-up (optional for scaling).
    - Jump your feet back to your hands and explode up into a jump, clapping overhead.

- **Form Tips**:
    - Keep your core tight to maintain a straight line during the plank.
    - Land softly to reduce impact on your joints.

- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - Step back instead of jumping for the plank.
    - Omit the push-up if needed, or perform them on your knees.

#### 3. **400m Run** (Repeat)

- Same as the first 400m run. Remember to focus on your pacing and recovery from the burpees.

#### 4. **30 Air Squats**

- **Technique Steps**:
    - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out.
    - Initiate the squat by pushing your hips back and bending your knees.
    - Keep your chest up and weight in your heels as you lower down.
    - Go as low as you can while maintaining good form, ideally to parallel or below.

- **Form Tips**:
    - Keep your knees tracking over your toes, not caving inward.
    - Use your arms for balance by extending them in front of you.

- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - Use a box or bench to squat to if you need assistance with depth.
    - Reduce the number of reps if necessary.

#### 5. **400m Run** (Repeat)

- Same as previous runs. Focus on maintaining your breath and form.

#### 6. **30 Push-Ups**

- **Technique Steps**:
    - Start in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width.
    - Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the ground, keeping your elbows at a 45-degree angle.
    - Push back up to the starting position, keeping your body straight throughout.

- **Form Tips**:
    - Engage your core to prevent sagging in your hips.
    - If you struggle with full push-ups, drop to your knees.

- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - Perform incline push-ups against a box or wall.
    - Reduce the number of reps if needed.

#### 7. **400m Run** (Final)

- Finish strong! This is your last run, so dig deep and push through to the end.

## Loading and Rep-Modification Options

- **Sweat**: Focus on form and pacing. Consider reducing the distance of the runs to 200m and the reps of each movement to 15.
  
- **Train**: Stick to the full distances and reps, but feel free to take short breaks as needed.

- **Compete**: Aim to complete the workout as prescribed, pushing for a personal best time. Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout.

### Strategy Advice

- **Pacing**: Start with a manageable pace on the runs. It‚Äôs better to finish strong than to burn out early.
- **Breaks**: Don‚Äôt be afraid to break up the movements into smaller sets, especially if you‚Äôre feeling fatigued.
- **Mindset**: Remember, this workout is as much mental as it is physical. Stay positive and keep pushing through!
