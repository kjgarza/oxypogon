## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality over quantity, focusing on building endurance and strength while maintaining good form. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of a mix of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to keep a steady pace and focus on your technique throughout each movement. Let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - **Rowing:** Sit on the rower with your feet secured. Start with your knees bent and arms extended. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - **Ski Erg:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grip the handles, and pull down while engaging your core and using your legs to drive the movement.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and core engaged.
    - For rowing, focus on a smooth, powerful leg drive followed by the pull.
    - For skiing, think of using your whole body, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing, aim for a lower intensity or shorter duration (e.g., 2:00).
    - For the Ski Erg, if you don’t have access, you can substitute with a stationary bike or jump rope for a similar cardio effect.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box. Step back down and switch legs.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and core tight as you step up.
    - Make sure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - If you have knee issues, you can perform step-ups without weights or do seated leg lifts instead.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, kettlebell between your feet. Hinge at the hips to grab the kettlebell. Drive through your heels, extending your hips, and pull the kettlebell up to your chin, keeping your elbows high.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and chest up during the hinge.
    - Use your legs to initiate the movement, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - If kettlebells are not available, you can substitute with dumbbell high pulls.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to pull your body up while keeping your feet on the ground. Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight. Pull your chest to the rings, then lower back down.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
    - Engage your core and avoid sagging your hips.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Adjust the height of the rings to make it easier or harder.
    - If rings are not available, you can do inverted rows using a barbell or TRX.

### Strategy Advice

- Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the workout. It’s better to go slower and keep your form than to rush and risk injury.
- Break up the reps if needed, especially on the kettlebell high pulls and ring rows, to maintain quality.
- Stay hydrated and listen to your body. If something feels off, don’t hesitate to modify or take a break.

Alright team, let’s get after it! Remember, quality over quantity, and have fun with it!
