## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today‚Äôs WOD is called ‚ÄúJIMMY,‚Äù and it‚Äôs an AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) in 30 minutes. The goal here is to build strength and endurance while keeping a steady pace throughout the workout. We‚Äôll be tackling three fundamental movements: Deadlifts, Pull-Ups, and Push-Ups. This combination will challenge your posterior chain, upper body pulling strength, and chest/tricep endurance. Let‚Äôs break it down step by step!

## Strength Segment

### 1. Deadlifts

- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, barbell over the midfoot.
    2. Bend at the hips and knees to grip the bar with both hands, just outside your knees.
    3. Keep your chest up and back flat, engaging your core.
    4. Push through your heels, extend your hips and knees simultaneously to lift the bar.
    5. Stand tall at the top, then hinge at the hips to lower the bar back down.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep the bar close to your body throughout the lift.
    - Avoid rounding your back; think about keeping your chest proud.
    - Engage your lats to stabilize your upper body.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter barbell or kettlebell if you‚Äôre new to deadlifts.
    - You can also perform the movement with a PVC pipe to focus on form.

### 2. Pull-Ups

- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Start by hanging from the pull-up bar with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width.
    2. Engage your shoulders and core, then pull your chin above the bar by driving your elbows down.
    3. Lower yourself back to the starting position with control.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body straight; avoid swinging or kipping unless you‚Äôre proficient.
    - Focus on pulling with your back, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you can‚Äôt do strict pull-ups, use a resistance band for assistance or perform ring rows.
    - You can also do jumping pull-ups, where you use your legs to help you get above the bar.

### 3. Push-Ups

- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Start in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
    2. Lower your body by bending your elbows, keeping them at about a 45-degree angle.
    3. Go down until your chest nearly touches the ground, then push back up to the starting position.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels; avoid sagging hips or raised butts.
    - Engage your core and glutes throughout the movement.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If regular push-ups are too challenging, drop to your knees for knee push-ups.
    - You can also perform incline push-ups with your hands on a box or bench.

## Strategy Advice

- **Pacing:** Since this is a 30-minute AMRAP, find a sustainable pace. It‚Äôs better to start slow and maintain your energy than to burn out early.
- **Break it up:** Don‚Äôt be afraid to break up your sets, especially on the Pull-Ups and Push-Ups. It‚Äôs better to do smaller sets with good form than to struggle through larger sets.
- **Stay focused:** Keep your transitions quick but controlled. Use the time between movements to catch your breath and mentally prepare for the next round.
