## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is an AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) for 35 minutes. This workout is designed to challenge your muscular endurance, core stability, and overall conditioning. We’ll be moving through a series of bodyweight and kettlebell movements that will get your heart rate up and build strength. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout, so listen closely as we break down each movement!

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Push-Ups

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Start in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
    - Lower your chest towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them at about a 45-degree angle.
    - Push through your palms to return to the starting position.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Engage your core to prevent sagging in your hips.
    - Keep your neck neutral; don’t let your head drop or jut forward.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If full push-ups are challenging, drop to your knees for a knee push-up.
    - Use an elevated surface (like a box or bench) for incline push-ups.

### 2. Alternating Jumping Lunges

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Start in a standing position.
    - Step forward with one leg into a lunge, lowering your back knee toward the ground.
    - Jump explosively, switching legs in mid-air, and land softly into the next lunge.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your front knee over your ankle; don’t let it go past your toes.
    - Use your arms to help with balance and momentum.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If jumping is too intense, perform alternating reverse lunges instead.
    - Reduce the number of reps if needed.

### 3. Tuck-Ups

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Lie flat on your back with your arms extended overhead and legs straight.
    - Engage your core and simultaneously lift your legs and upper body, reaching your hands towards your shins.
    - Lower back down with control and repeat.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your lower back pressed into the ground to protect your spine.
    - Focus on using your core, not your neck, to lift.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If tuck-ups are too challenging, try bent-knee sit-ups or crunches.
    - Reduce the number of reps if necessary.

### 4. Double Kettlebell Deadlifts

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet hip-width apart, kettlebells on the ground between your feet.
    - Hinge at your hips and bend your knees to grasp the kettlebells.
    - Keep your chest up and back flat as you lift the kettlebells by extending your hips and knees simultaneously.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep the kettlebells close to your body as you lift.
    - Avoid rounding your back; maintain a neutral spine throughout.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a single kettlebell for a single-arm deadlift if double kettlebells are too heavy.
    - Reduce the weight of the kettlebells as needed.

### 5. Glute Bridges

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart.
    - Press through your heels and lift your hips towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top.
    - Lower back down with control and repeat.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your shoulders relaxed and avoid arching your back.
    - Engage your core to maintain stability.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you want more challenge, try single-leg glute bridges.
    - Reduce the number of reps if necessary.
