## Workout Overview

Hey team! Today’s WOD is all about quality over quantity, focusing on building endurance and strength through a series of movements that will challenge your body while keeping your form sharp. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain a steady pace and focus on technique throughout each round. Let’s break it down!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - For the Row: Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and your back straight.
    - Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - Reverse the motion: extend your arms, lean forward, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.
    - For the Ski Erg: Stand tall, grab the handles, and start with your arms extended overhead.
    - Pull the handles down towards your hips, engaging your core and using your legs to assist the movement.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement; your arms should follow.
    - For the Ski Erg, maintain a strong core to stabilize your body.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing, focus on shorter intervals (1:00) to build confidence.
    - On the Ski Erg, reduce the resistance if needed.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with your feet hip-width apart.
    - Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
    - Bring the other foot up to meet the first, then step back down one foot at a time.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
    - Ensure your entire foot is on the box to avoid slipping.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re still building strength or balance.
    - Perform step-ups without weights to focus on form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out, and the kettlebell on the ground between your feet.
    - Hinge at the hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands.
    - Drive through your heels, extending your hips and knees, and pull the kettlebell up to your chin, keeping your elbows high.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and chest up during the lift.
    - Use your legs to generate power, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell or perform the movement without weight to practice the technique.
    - If kettlebells are unavailable, you can substitute with dumbbells.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back with your arms extended.
    - Grab the rings and walk your feet forward until your body is at an angle.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings, keeping your body straight and core engaged.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Avoid letting your hips sag; keep a straight line from head to heels.
    - Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If rings are too challenging, perform inverted rows on a bar or use a TRX.
    - Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier or harder.

### Strategy Advice

As you tackle this WOD, remember to pace yourself. Focus on maintaining good form rather than rushing through the reps. Breaking up the movements into manageable sets can help you maintain quality throughout the workout. Listen to your body, and don’t hesitate to scale if you need to. Let’s get after it and have some fun!
