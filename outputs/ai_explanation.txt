## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality and maintaining good movement patterns while getting in some solid work. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of a mix of cardio, strength, and bodyweight movements. The goal here is to focus on form and technique while building endurance and strength. Remember, it’s not just about getting through the rounds; it’s about doing each movement well!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - **Rowing:** Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and your back straight. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest.
    - **Ski Erg:** Stand tall with the handles in each hand. Start with your arms extended overhead. Pull down with your arms while simultaneously bending your knees slightly, engaging your core.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement.
    - For rowing, focus on driving through your legs first before pulling with your arms.
    - For the Ski Erg, use your legs to help drive the movement down, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing, reduce the time to 2:00 or focus on technique rather than speed.
    - For the Ski Erg, if you don’t have access, you can substitute with a light jog or jump rope for the same duration.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
    - Bring your other foot up to meet the first, then step back down one foot at a time.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core as you step up.
    - Make sure your entire foot is on the box to avoid slipping.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - If you have knee issues, you can perform step-ups without weights or do seated leg lifts instead.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out. Hold the kettlebell with both hands in front of you.
    - Hinge at your hips and lower the kettlebell between your legs. Drive through your heels, extend your hips, and pull the kettlebell up to your chin, keeping your elbows high.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and core tight during the hinge.
    - Use your legs to drive the kettlebell up rather than just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - If kettlebells aren’t available, you can substitute with dumbbell high pulls or bodyweight squats.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to pull yourself up. Grab the rings with an overhand grip and lean back, keeping your body straight.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings while keeping your elbows close to your body, then lower back down.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
    - Engage your core to avoid sagging or arching your back.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you can’t do ring rows, you can substitute with inverted rows on a bar or bent-over rows with a dumbbell.
    - Adjust the height of the rings to make it easier or harder based on your strength level.

### Strategy Advice

As you tackle this WOD, remember to pace yourself. Focus on maintaining good form throughout each movement rather than rushing through. It’s better to take a few extra seconds to ensure you’re executing each rep correctly. Break up the sets if you need to, especially on the kettlebell pulls and ring rows, to maintain quality. Let’s have fun and get after it!
