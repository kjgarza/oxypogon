## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality movement and building endurance. We’re going to tackle this in 6 rounds, focusing on maintaining good form and a steady pace throughout. The goal here is to challenge your cardiovascular fitness and muscular endurance while ensuring that each movement is executed with precision. Let’s break it down!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - For the Row: Sit with your feet strapped in, knees bent, and grip the handle. Start with your arms extended and back straight.
    - Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - Reverse the movement: extend your arms, lean forward, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.
    - For the Ski Erg: Stand tall with a slight bend in your knees. Grip the handles and pull down while engaging your core, driving your elbows back.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and avoid hunching over.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.
    - For the Ski Erg, focus on a smooth, controlled motion rather than rushing.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing, aim for a slower pace to focus on technique.
    - For the Ski Erg, reduce the time to 2:00 if needed.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart. 
    - Step up onto the box with one foot, driving through your heel to lift your body up.
    - Bring the other foot up to meet the first on the box, then step back down one foot at a time.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
    - Make sure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down to avoid any missteps.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on balance and form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Place the kettlebell between your feet.
    - Hinge at the hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands.
    - Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up towards your chin while keeping your elbows high.
    - Lower the kettlebell back down to the ground and repeat.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and chest up during the hinge.
    - Focus on using your legs to initiate the movement rather than your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - If kettlebells are not available, you can perform dumbbell high pulls instead.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to pull yourself up comfortably. 
    - Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings while keeping your elbows close to your body.
    - Lower yourself back down with control.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Maintain a straight line from your head to your heels throughout the movement.
    - Avoid swinging; focus on a controlled pull.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If ring rows are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows using a barbell or TRX straps.
    - Alternatively, you can do bodyweight rows on a low bar.
