## Strength Segment

### Back Squats

**Overview**: The Back Squat is a foundational movement that targets your quads, hamstrings, glutes, and core. Proper form is crucial to prevent injury and maximize strength gains.

- **Technique Steps**:
    1. Start with the barbell resting on your upper traps, feet shoulder-width apart.
    2. Engage your core and take a deep breath.
    3. Initiate the squat by pushing your hips back and bending your knees.
    4. Keep your chest up and back straight as you lower down until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground.
    5. Drive through your heels to stand back up, fully extending your hips and knees at the top.

- **Form Tips**:
    - Keep your knees tracking over your toes; avoid letting them cave inward.
    - Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
    - Use a spotter or squat rack if you‚Äôre lifting heavy.

- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - If you‚Äôre new to squats, start with bodyweight squats or a lighter barbell.
    - Use a box or bench to help gauge depth if you‚Äôre unsure about your range of motion.

- **Loading**:
    - **Sweat**: Start at 50% of your 1RM and aim for 50-60% for the working sets.
    - **Train**: Build up to 70-75% of your 1RM.
    - **Compete**: Aim for 75-80% of your 1RM for the final sets.

## Conditioning Segment [AMRAP 16]

### Buy-in: 60 Box Jumps (24"/20")

**Overview**: Box jumps are a fantastic way to build explosive power and improve your cardiovascular fitness. 

- **Technique Steps**:
    1. Stand facing the box with your feet shoulder-width apart.
    2. Bend your knees and swing your arms back to generate momentum.
    3. Jump onto the box, landing softly with your knees slightly bent.
    4. Stand up fully on the box before stepping or jumping back down.

- **Form Tips**:
    - Focus on landing softly to absorb the impact.
    - Use your arms to help propel you upward.
    - Keep your core engaged to maintain balance.

- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - Step-ups can be a great alternative if jumping is too challenging.
    - Use a lower box height if you‚Äôre not comfortable with the standard height.

### AMRAP: 8 Alternating Front Rack Reverse Lunges

**Overview**: This movement targets your legs and core while also challenging your balance and stability.

- **Technique Steps**:
    1. Hold a barbell or dumbbells in the front rack position (across your shoulders).
    2. Step back with one leg into a lunge, keeping your front knee over your ankle.
    3. Lower your back knee toward the ground without touching it.
    4. Push through your front heel to return to standing and switch legs.

- **Form Tips**:
    - Keep your torso upright and core engaged.
    - Ensure your front knee doesn‚Äôt extend past your toes.
    - Control your movement to maintain balance.

- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - Use lighter weights or perform the lunges without weights to focus on form.
    - If lunges are difficult, you can substitute with bodyweight lunges or split squats.

### 50 Double Unders

**Overview**: Double unders are a high-intensity cardio movement that also improves coordination and timing.

- **Technique Steps**:
    1. Start with the jump rope behind your heels.
    2. Jump slightly higher than a single under and swing the rope twice under your feet before landing.
    3. Keep your elbows close to your body and use your wrists to control the rope.

- **Form Tips**:
    - Stay light on your feet and keep your jumps quick and controlled.
    - Practice single unders if you‚Äôre still mastering double unders.

- **Scaling/Modifications**:
    - If you‚Äôre not comfortable with double unders, do single unders instead.
    - You can also reduce the number of reps to manage fatigue.

## Strategy Advice

- For the Back Squats, focus on maintaining good form and building up to your working weight gradually.
- During the conditioning piece, pace yourself on the box jumps to avoid burning out early. Break the lunges into manageable sets if needed, and keep a steady rhythm on the double unders.
- Remember, it‚Äôs about quality over quantity, so prioritize your form and technique throughout the workout.
