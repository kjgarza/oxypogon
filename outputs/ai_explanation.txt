## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Handstand Push-Ups (HSPU)

#### Technique Steps:
- Start in a handstand position against a wall, with your hands shoulder-width apart.
- Lower your head towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your body.
- Press back up to the starting position, engaging your shoulders and core throughout.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your body straight and avoid arching your back.
- Focus on a controlled descent and a powerful push back up.
- Use a spotter if needed for safety and support.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If youâ€™re new to HSPUs, try doing them on an elevated surface like a box or with your feet on the ground (pike push-ups).
- You can also perform strict shoulder presses with a barbell or dumbbells if HSPUs are too challenging.

### 2. Thrusters

#### Technique Steps:
- Start with the barbell resting on your shoulders, feet shoulder-width apart.
- Squat down, keeping your chest up and weight in your heels.
- As you stand up, press the barbell overhead in one fluid motion.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your elbows high and your core tight throughout the movement.
- Make sure to fully extend your arms overhead at the top of the movement.
- Avoid leaning back; your body should be in a straight line from your heels to your hands.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lighter barbell or dumbbells if needed.
- If youâ€™re still working on your squat form, you can perform front squats without the press.

### 3. Knees-to-Elbows

#### Technique Steps:
- Hang from a pull-up bar with an overhand grip, arms fully extended.
- Engage your core and pull your knees up towards your elbows, aiming to touch them.
- Lower your legs back down with control.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your shoulders engaged and avoid swinging.
- Focus on using your core rather than your hip flexors to lift your knees.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If you canâ€™t reach your elbows yet, try bringing your knees to your chest instead (knee raises).
- You can also perform hanging leg raises or even lying down knee tucks if hanging is too difficult.

### 4. Box Step-Ups (24"/20")

#### Technique Steps:
- Stand in front of the box with your feet hip-width apart.
- Step up onto the box with one foot, driving through your heel.
- Stand tall at the top, then step back down with control.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your chest up and engage your core as you step up.
- Alternate legs for each rep or complete all reps on one leg before switching.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lower box if the height is too challenging.
- If youâ€™re looking for a less intense option, you can perform step-ups without weights.
