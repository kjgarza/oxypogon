# Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is a fantastic blend of strength and conditioning that’s going to challenge your technique and endurance. We’ll kick things off with a Clean Complex to refine our lifting skills and build strength, followed by a conditioning piece that will really get your heart pumping. The goal here is to focus on form, build confidence in your lifts, and maintain a steady pace during the conditioning rounds.

## Strength Segment

### Clean Complex (On the 2:00 x 6)

**Movement Breakdown:**
- **2 Deadlifts**
- **2 Hang Power Cleans**

#### Technique Steps:
1. **Deadlift:**
   - Start with your feet hip-width apart, barbell over the mid-foot.
   - Grip the bar just outside your knees, keeping your back flat and chest up.
   - Engage your core, push through your heels, and lift the bar by extending your hips and knees simultaneously.
   - Stand tall at the top, then reverse the movement to lower the bar back down.

2. **Hang Power Clean:**
   - From standing, hinge at your hips to lower the bar to just above your knees (the hang position).
   - Keep your chest up and back flat.
   - Explosively extend through your hips, shrug your shoulders, and pull the bar up, keeping it close to your body.
   - Drop under the bar into a partial squat, catching it on your shoulders with elbows high.
   - Stand up to finish the rep.

#### Form Tips:
- **Deadlift:** Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders. Engage your lats to keep the bar close.
- **Hang Power Clean:** Focus on a strong hip extension and keep the bar path vertical. Your elbows should be high and outside as you catch the bar.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lighter barbell or a PVC pipe if you’re new to the movements or focusing on form.
- If you struggle with the hang position, you can perform the cleans from the floor.

#### Loading:
- Start at 50% of your 1RM Hang Power Clean and aim to build up to 85% over the six sets. Focus on maintaining good form rather than just lifting heavy.

## Conditioning Segment [5 Rounds]

### Part 1: 5 Rounds
- **12 Deadlifts**
- **10/8 Calories on the Bike or 13/11 Calories on the Row**

#### Movement Breakdown:
1. **Deadlifts:**
   - Same as above, focus on maintaining form and a steady pace.

2. **Calories on Bike/Row:**
   - For the bike, adjust the seat height so your legs can extend fully.
   - For the row, sit tall, engage your core, and drive with your legs while pulling the handle towards your chest.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Reduce the number of deadlifts to 8 if needed.
- Use a lighter weight for the deadlifts if you’re feeling fatigued.

### Part 2: Directly Into 5 Rounds
- **9 Hang Power Cleans**
- **10/8 Calories on the Bike or 13/11 Calories on the Row**

#### Movement Breakdown:
1. **Hang Power Cleans:**
   - Same as above, focus on technique and speed.

2. **Calories on Bike/Row:**
   - Same as above, maintain a steady effort.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If you’re new to the hang power clean, reduce the reps to 6.
- Use lighter weights or perform the movement with dumbbells if necessary.

## Loading Options:
- **Sweat:** 30/20 kg for the deadlifts and hang power cleans, use tuck-ups if needed for the conditioning.
- **Train:** 45/30 kg for the deadlifts and hang power cleans.
- **Compete:** 60/40 kg for the deadlifts and hang power cleans.

### Strategy Advice:
- For the conditioning piece, aim for a steady pace. Break up the deadlifts into manageable sets if needed, especially as you transition into the hang power cleans. Stay focused on your breathing and maintain a rhythm on the bike or rower to keep your heart rate steady.

Remember, form is key throughout this workout. Prioritize technique over weight, and don’t hesitate to scale if you need to. Let’s have a great session today!
