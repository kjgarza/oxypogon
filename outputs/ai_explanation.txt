The goal here is to maximize your reps while maintaining good form. This workout will challenge your cardiovascular fitness, muscular endurance, and core stability. Letâ€™s break it down!

## Workout Components

### 1. Burpee to Target

- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Start standing tall with your feet shoulder-width apart.
    2. Drop into a squat, placing your hands on the ground.
    3. Jump your feet back into a plank position, keeping your body in a straight line.
    4. Perform a push-up (optional, depending on your fitness level).
    5. Jump your feet back towards your hands.
    6. Explode up, reaching your hands to touch a target (like a wall or a bar) above your head.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your core engaged throughout to maintain a straight body line.
    - Land softly on your feet to reduce impact on your joints.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Step back instead of jumping if you need to reduce intensity.
    - Remove the push-up for a simpler version, or just perform a squat thrust.

### 2. Wall Balls

- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a medicine ball at chest level.
    2. Squat down, keeping your chest up and weight in your heels.
    3. As you rise from the squat, throw the ball up to a target on the wall (aim for 9-10 feet).
    4. Catch the ball as it comes down and immediately go into the next squat.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Use your legs to drive the ball up, not just your arms.
    - Keep your elbows high to maintain control of the ball.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter medicine ball or perform air squats if youâ€™re new to this movement.
    - If you donâ€™t have a wall, you can do thrusters with a dumbbell.

### 3. V-Ups

- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Lie flat on your back with your arms extended overhead and legs straight.
    2. Simultaneously lift your legs and upper body off the ground, reaching your hands towards your feet.
    3. Lower back down with control and repeat.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your core tight to avoid straining your lower back.
    - Aim to touch your toes at the top of the movement for maximum engagement.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If V-Ups are too challenging, perform tuck-ups by bringing your knees to your chest instead.
    - You can also do sit-ups as a simpler alternative.

### 4. Bike

- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Adjust the bike to fit your height and ensure the seat is at hip level.
    2. Start pedaling at a steady pace, focusing on smooth, controlled movements.
    3. Engage your core and keep your back straight as you pedal.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Use a full range of motion with your legs, pushing down and pulling up.
    - Keep your hands relaxed on the handlebars.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you donâ€™t have a bike, you can substitute with a jump rope or run in place.

### 5. Wall Walk

- **Technique Steps:**
    1. Start in a plank position with your feet against the wall.
    2. Walk your feet up the wall while simultaneously walking your hands closer to the wall.
    3. Aim to get your chest as close to the wall as possible.
    4. Reverse the movement to return to the starting position.
  
- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your core engaged to maintain stability.
    - Move slowly and with control to avoid falling.
  
- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If wall walks are too challenging, perform shoulder taps in a plank position instead.
    - You can also do a downward dog hold against the wall.

### Strategy Advice

- **Pacing:** Start strong but find a sustainable pace. Remember, you have 7 rounds, so donâ€™t burn out in the first few.
- **Breaks:** Use your 15 seconds of rest wisely. Catch your breath and mentally prepare for the next round.
- **Form First:** Always prioritize form over speed. Itâ€™s better to do fewer reps correctly than to rush and risk injury.
