## Strength Segment: Back Squats
1. **Back Squats (On the 2:00 x 6)**
   - **Technique Steps:**
     - Start by setting the barbell on your upper traps, standing tall with your feet shoulder-width apart.
     - Take a deep breath, brace your core, and lower yourself by bending at the hips and knees, keeping your chest up and back straight.
     - Aim to get your thighs parallel to the ground or lower, depending on your mobility.
     - Push through your heels to return to standing, fully extending your hips at the top.
   - **Form Tips:**
     - Keep your knees tracking over your toes; avoid letting them cave inward.
     - Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement; don’t let your back round.
   - **Scaling/Modifications:**
     - If you’re new to squats, you can use a lighter barbell or even a bodyweight squat to focus on form.
     - Consider using a box or bench to help gauge your depth.
   - **Loading:**
     - Start at 50% of your 1RM and aim to build to 75-80%. Listen to your body and adjust as needed.

## Conditioning Segment: EMOM x 16 (4 Rounds)
### Minute 1: X Calories Ski Erg
   - **Technique Steps:**
     - Sit on the Ski Erg with your feet secured and hands on the handles.
     - Engage your core and initiate the movement by pulling down with your arms while driving your knees up slightly.
     - Use your legs to push off the ground, allowing your arms to follow through in a fluid motion.
   - **Form Tips:**
     - Keep your back straight and avoid leaning too far forward or backward.
     - Focus on a smooth rhythm; it’s about efficiency, not just speed.
   - **Scaling/Modifications:**
     - If you don’t have access to a Ski Erg, you can substitute with a rower or a bike for calories.
   - **Caloric Targets:**
     - Sweat: 11/8 Cal.; Train: 13/10 Cal.; Compete: 15/12 Cal.

### Minute 2: 16 Alternating Kettlebell Goblet Reverse Lunges
   - **Technique Steps:**
     - Hold a kettlebell close to your chest with both hands, elbows tucked in.
     - Step back with one leg, lowering your back knee toward the ground while keeping your front knee aligned over your ankle.
     - Push through your front heel to return to standing and switch legs.
   - **Form Tips:**
     - Keep your torso upright and avoid leaning forward.
     - Ensure your front knee doesn’t extend past your toes.
   - **Scaling/Modifications:**
     - Use a lighter kettlebell or perform bodyweight lunges if needed.
     - If balance is an issue, you can hold onto a wall or rack for support.

## Strategy Advice
- **Pacing:** For the EMOM, find a pace that allows you to complete the work without burning out. It’s better to start conservatively and build up your intensity as you go.
- **Breaking Up Sets:** If you find the kettlebell movements challenging, feel free to break them into smaller sets (like 8 reps at a time) to maintain good form.
- **Hydration:** Don’t forget to hydrate before, during, and after your workout!

Remember, focus on your form and listen to your body. Let’s have a great workout today!
