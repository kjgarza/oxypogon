### Expert Explanation
## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality and building endurance while focusing on movement efficiency. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of a mix of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement and to keep a steady pace. Let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - **Rowing:** Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and your back straight. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - **Ski Erg:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grab the handles, and start with your arms extended. Engage your core, and pull the handles down towards your hips while bending your knees slightly.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and avoid slouching.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement; your arms should follow.
    - For the Ski Erg, focus on using your core and legs to generate power.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing, aim for a slower pace to focus on technique.
    - For the Ski Erg, reduce the time to 2:00 if needed.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to stand tall on the box. Step back down with the same foot and repeat on the other side.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core.
    - Make sure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down.
    - Use a controlled motion; don’t rush through the reps.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - If you have knee issues, consider doing step-ups without weights or using a bench.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Hold the kettlebell with both hands in front of you. Hinge at your hips to lower the kettlebell down, then explosively extend your hips and pull the kettlebell up to your chin, keeping your elbows high.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and core engaged throughout the movement.
    - Drive through your heels as you lift the kettlebell.
    - Avoid using your arms too much; focus on the hip drive.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - If kettlebells aren’t available, you can substitute with dumbbells.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably pull yourself up. Grab the rings with an overhand grip, lean back, and keep your body straight. Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
    - Engage your core and avoid sagging your hips.
    - Focus on pulling with your back, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If rings are too challenging, use a barbell in a squat rack for inverted rows.
    - Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier or harder.

    - Row/Ski: 2:00
    - Box Step-Ups: 16/8
    - Kettlebell: 16kg/8kg

### Strategy Advice

- Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the workout. It’s better to keep moving than to go all out and burn out early.
- Break up the box step-ups and kettlebell high pulls into manageable sets if needed.
- Remember to breathe and keep your core engaged to support your movements.

Alright, team! Let’s get after it and focus on quality reps today. Keep your form sharp, and let’s have some fun!
