### Expert Explanation
# Workout Overview

Hey team! Today’s WOD is a team workout designed to challenge your strength, endurance, and coordination. You’ll be working in pairs to complete a series of movements for time, which means you’ll need to communicate and strategize with your partner. The workout consists of 80 Handstand Push-Ups, 120 Thrusters, 160 Knees-to-Elbows, and 200 Box Step-Ups. The goal here is to push your limits while supporting each other, so let’s break it down!

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Handstand Push-Ups (HSPU)

**Technique Steps:**
- Start in a handstand position against a wall or freestanding if you’re comfortable.
- Lower your head towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your body.
- Press back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your core tight to maintain a straight line from your hands to your feet.
- Look slightly forward, not straight down, to keep your neck in a neutral position.
- Engage your shoulders throughout the movement.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- If you’re new to HSPUs, try using a box or a set of ab mats to reduce the range of motion.
- You can also perform pike push-ups on a box or the floor to build strength.

### 2. Thrusters

**Technique Steps:**
- Start with the barbell resting on your shoulders, feet shoulder-width apart.
- Squat down, keeping your chest up and weight in your heels.
- As you stand up, press the barbell overhead in one fluid motion.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your elbows high and your core engaged throughout the squat and press.
- Drive through your heels and use your legs to help push the bar overhead.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- Use a lighter barbell or dumbbells if you’re still developing your strength.
- If you’re not comfortable with the overhead press, you can perform front squats instead.

### 3. Knees-to-Elbows

**Technique Steps:**
- Hang from a pull-up bar with an overhand grip, arms fully extended.
- Engage your core and pull your knees up towards your elbows, aiming to touch them.
- Lower your legs back down with control.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your shoulders engaged and avoid swinging your legs.
- Focus on using your core to lift your knees rather than relying on momentum.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- If you find this too challenging, try hanging knee raises or tuck-ups instead.
- You can also perform the movement on a low bar or rings for added stability.

### 4. Box Step-Ups (24"/20")

**Technique Steps:**
- Stand in front of the box with your feet hip-width apart.
- Step up onto the box with one foot, driving through your heel to stand tall.
- Step back down and repeat with the opposite leg.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your chest up and engage your core as you step.
- Make sure your entire foot is on the box before standing up.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- If the height of the box is too challenging, use a lower box or perform step-ups onto a sturdy platform.
- You can also perform alternating lunges instead if you prefer.
