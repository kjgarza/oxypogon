## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

**Technique Steps:**
- **Rowing:**
  - Start by sitting on the rower with your feet secured in the foot straps.
  - Grip the handle with both hands, arms extended, and lean slightly forward from your hips.
  - Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.
  - Reverse the motion by extending your arms, leaning forward, and bending your knees to return to the starting position.
  
- **Ski Erg:**
  - Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and grip the handles.
  - Engage your core and pull the handles down towards your hips while simultaneously bending your knees slightly.
  - Return to the starting position by extending your arms overhead.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your back straight and core engaged to avoid rounding your spine.
- For rowing, focus on using your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- If you’re new to rowing, consider reducing the time to 2:00.
- For Ski Erg, you can also perform a seated row with a resistance band if equipment is limited.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

**Technique Steps:**
- Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart.
- Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
- Bring your other foot up to meet the first, standing tall at the top.
- Step back down one foot at a time and repeat.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
- Ensure your entire foot is on the box to maintain balance.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
- You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

**Technique Steps:**
- Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, kettlebell on the floor between your feet.
- Hinge at your hips and bend your knees to grab the kettlebell with both hands.
- Drive through your heels, extending your hips and knees while pulling the kettlebell up to your chin, keeping your elbows high.
- Lower the kettlebell back down to the floor and repeat.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your back flat and chest up during the lift.
- Use your legs to initiate the movement, not just your arms.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
- If kettlebells are not available, you can substitute with dumbbells.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

**Technique Steps:**
- Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back comfortably.
- Grab the rings with an overhand grip and walk your feet forward until your body is at an angle.
- Pull your chest towards the rings while keeping your body straight, then lower back down.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your core tight and avoid sagging your hips.
- Focus on pulling with your back and arms, not just your shoulders.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows using a barbell at waist height.
- Alternatively, you can do bent-over dumbbell rows.
