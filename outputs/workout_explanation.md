### Expert Explanation
## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality and consistency. We’re going to tackle 6 rounds of a mix of cardio and strength movements. The goal here is to maintain good form and focus on each rep rather than rushing through. This workout will challenge your endurance, strength, and coordination, so let’s break it down step by step!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - For the Row: Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and arms extended. Drive through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest.
    - For the Ski Erg: Stand tall, grab the handles, and start with your arms extended. Use your legs to drive down while pulling the handles towards your hips, keeping your core engaged.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and core tight. Avoid rounding your back.
    - In the row, focus on pushing with your legs first, then pulling with your arms.
    - In the Ski Erg, use your legs to generate power, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the intensity by going at a slower pace.
    - You can also switch to a stationary bike or a light jog if needed.

### 2. Box Step-ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand in front of the box with your feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box. Bring your other foot up to meet it, then step back down one foot at a time.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
    - Make sure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down to avoid any slips.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, kettlebell on the ground between your feet. Hinge at your hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands. Stand up, pulling the kettlebell up along your body, leading with your elbows until it’s at chest height.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and chest up as you hinge.
    - Ensure your elbows are higher than your wrists at the top of the movement.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - If kettlebells aren’t available, you can substitute with dumbbells or perform a standard deadlift.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them. Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight. Pull your chest towards the rings while keeping your elbows close to your body.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Maintain a straight line from your head to your heels.
    - Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows on a bar or use a TRX strap.
    - Adjust the angle of your body to make it easier or harder.

## Loading and Rep-Modification Options

- **Sweat:** 
    - Row/Ski: Moderate pace, focus on form.
    - Box Step-ups: 16” box for women, 8” for men.
    - Kettlebell: 12kg/8kg.
    - Ring Rows: Feet on the ground for assistance.

- **Train:** 
    - Row/Ski: Steady pace, aim for consistent splits.
    - Box Step-ups: 20” box for women, 12” for men.
    - Kettlebell: 16kg/12kg.
    - Ring Rows: Standard height, focus on full range of motion.

- **Compete:** 
    - Row/Ski: Push for max effort.
    - Box Step-ups: 24” box for men, 16” for women.
    - Kettlebell: 24kg/16kg.
    - Ring Rows: Full range, no assistance.

### Strategy Advice

- **Pacing:** Start with a steady pace on the row or ski, and don’t go all out right away. You want to maintain energy for all 6 rounds.
- **Breaks:** Take short breaks between movements if needed, but try to keep them minimal to maintain your heart rate.
- **Focus on Quality:** Remember, this workout is for quality, so prioritize good form over speed. It’s better to do fewer reps correctly than to rush through and risk injury.

Alright team, let’s get after it! Remember to listen to your body, and let’s have some fun with this workout!
