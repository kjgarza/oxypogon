## Strategy Advice
- **Pacing:** Start at a steady pace that you can maintain throughout the 35 minutes. It’s better to go slower and maintain form than to burn out early.
- **Breaks:** Don’t be afraid to take short breaks between movements, especially on the pull-ups and handstand push-ups. 
- **Hydration:** Keep water nearby and stay hydrated throughout the workout.

Remember, the goal is to challenge yourself while maintaining good form. Let’s have fun and crush this WOD together!
