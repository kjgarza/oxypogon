### Expert Explanation
## Workout Overview

Hey team! Today’s WOD is all about quality and endurance, structured into six rounds of varied movements that will challenge your cardiovascular fitness, strength, and coordination. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while focusing on the quality of your movements rather than just speed. Let’s break it down step by step!

## WOD Breakdown

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

**Technique Steps:**
- **Rowing:**
  - Sit on the rower with your feet secured in the foot straps.
  - Grip the handle with both hands, arms extended, and back straight.
  - Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest.
  - Reverse the motion: extend your arms, hinge at the hips, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.
  
- **Ski Erg:**
  - Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, gripping the handles.
  - Engage your core and pull the handles down towards your hips while simultaneously bending your knees slightly.
  - Return to the starting position with control.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.
- Use your legs to drive the movement; your arms should follow.
- Maintain a steady rhythm throughout the 3 minutes.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or 1:30.
- Focus on technique rather than speed; it’s okay to take breaks as needed.

### 2. Box Step-ups (20 reps)

**Technique Steps:**
- Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart.
- Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
- Bring your other foot up to meet the first on the box, then step back down one foot at a time.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your chest up and core engaged throughout the movement.
- Ensure your entire foot is on the box before stepping down.
- Alternate the leading foot for balanced development.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- Use a lower box if you’re unsure about your balance or strength.
- If you have knee issues, consider stepping onto a sturdy platform instead of a box.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps, 24/16 kg)

**Technique Steps:**
- Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out.
- Place the kettlebell between your feet and hinge at the hips to grab the handle.
- Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up towards your chin, keeping your elbows high.
- Lower the kettlebell back down with control.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your back flat and chest up during the hinge.
- Use your legs to initiate the lift; your arms should follow.
- Avoid using your back to lift the kettlebell; focus on your legs and hips.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- Use a lighter kettlebell or perform the movement without weight to focus on form.
- If you have limited mobility, consider performing a kettlebell deadlift instead.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

**Technique Steps:**
- Set the rings at a height that allows you to lean back with your arms extended.
- Grab the rings with an overhand grip and lean back, keeping your body straight.
- Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
- Lower yourself back to the starting position with control.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels; avoid sagging your hips.
- Engage your core throughout the movement.
- Focus on pulling with your back, not just your arms.

**Scaling/Modifications:**
- Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier or harder.
- If rings are too challenging, perform inverted rows on a barbell or use a TRX.
