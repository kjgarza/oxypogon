### Expert Explanation
# Workout Overview
Hey everyone! Todayâ€™s WOD is designed to build upper body strength and endurance while also hitting those legs and core. Weâ€™ll start with a strength segment focusing on the Strict Press, where weâ€™ll gradually build up to a heavy single. Then, weâ€™ll dive into a conditioning piece that combines some dumbbell work with bodyweight movements. The goal here is to challenge your muscular endurance and keep your heart rate up. Letâ€™s break it down!

## Strength Segment: Strict Press
1. **Strict Press**
   - **Technique Steps:**
     - Start with your feet shoulder-width apart and the barbell resting on your shoulders, elbows slightly in front.
     - Engage your core and glutes to maintain a strong, stable base.
     - Press the bar directly overhead, keeping it close to your face and moving in a straight line.
     - Lock out your arms overhead, ensuring your shoulders are active and not shrugging up.
     - Lower the bar back to your shoulders with control.
   - **Form Tips:**
     - Keep your ribcage down and avoid arching your back.
     - Your head should move slightly back as the bar passes, then return to neutral as you lock out.
   - **Scaling/Modifications:**
     - If youâ€™re new to the movement, use a lighter barbell or even a PVC pipe to focus on form.
     - You can also perform the Strict Press seated if standing is uncomfortable.
   - **Loading:**
     - Start at a weight you can comfortably lift for 10 reps, then gradually increase the weight for each set, aiming to find your 1RM by the end of the session.

## Conditioning Segment
### Set 1: Double Dumbbell Floor Press & Bent Over Rows
2. **15 Double Dumbbell Floor Press**
   - **Technique Steps:**
     - Lie on your back with a dumbbell in each hand, elbows resting on the floor.
     - Press the dumbbells up until your arms are fully extended, then lower them back down.
   - **Form Tips:**
     - Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle to your body.
     - Engage your core to prevent your back from arching.
   - **Scaling/Modifications:**
     - Use lighter dumbbells if needed, or perform a single-arm floor press if you need to reduce the load.
   - **Loading:**
     - Sweat: 15/10 kg, Train: 17.5/12.5 kg, Compete: 22.5/15 kg.

3. **Max Double Dumbbell Bent Over Rows**
   - **Technique Steps:**
     - Hinge at your hips, keeping your back flat and knees slightly bent.
     - Hold a dumbbell in each hand, arms extended towards the floor.
     - Pull the dumbbells towards your hips, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top.
   - **Form Tips:**
     - Keep your elbows close to your body and avoid rounding your back.
     - Focus on controlled movements rather than rushing through the reps.
   - **Scaling/Modifications:**
     - If youâ€™re struggling with the weight, reduce the dumbbell load or perform the rows one arm at a time.
   - **Loading:**
     - Same as above for the floor press.

### Set 2: Dumbbell Reverse Lunges & Sit-Ups
4. **20 Dumbbell Reverse Lunges**
   - **Technique Steps:**
     - Stand tall with a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.
     - Step back with one leg, lowering your back knee towards the ground while keeping your front knee over your ankle.
     - Push through your front heel to return to standing, alternating legs.
   - **Form Tips:**
     - Keep your chest up and core engaged throughout the movement.
     - Ensure your front knee doesnâ€™t extend past your toes.
   - **Scaling/Modifications:**
     - If lunges are tough, you can perform them without weights or do step-ups instead.
   - **Loading:**
     - Same as above.

5. **Max Sit-Ups**
   - **Technique Steps:**
     - Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
     - Cross your arms over your chest or place your hands behind your head.
     - Engage your core and lift your upper body towards your knees, then lower back down.
   - **Form Tips:**
     - Avoid pulling on your neck; keep your chin tucked.
     - Focus on using your core to lift rather than momentum.
   - **Scaling/Modifications:**
     - If sit-ups are challenging, you can do crunches or even use an ab mat for support.
   - **Loading:**
     - No weights needed here, just focus on quality reps.

## Strategy Advice
- **Pacing:** For the conditioning sets, aim for a steady pace. Itâ€™s better to break up your reps into manageable sets rather than going all out and burning out early.
- **Rest:** Use the rest between sets wisely. Hydrate and mentally prepare for the next round.
- **Focus on Form:** Remember, quality over quantity! Itâ€™s better to do fewer reps with good form than to rush through and risk injury.

Alright team, letâ€™s get after it! Remember to listen to your body, scale as needed, and most importantly, have fun! Letâ€™s crush this WOD together! ðŸ’ª
