## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality over quantity, focusing on building endurance and strength through a series of movements that will challenge your cardiovascular system and muscular endurance. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of rowing or skiing, followed by box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while keeping a steady pace. Let’s break it down!

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Setup**: Adjust the damper setting to a level that feels comfortable for you. Sit on the erg with your feet secured in the straps.
- **Rowing**: Start with your legs fully extended, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest while driving through your legs. 
- **Skiing**: Stand tall, grip the handles, and use your legs and arms in a coordinated motion, pulling down and back as you push with your legs.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your back straight and core engaged.
- For rowing, focus on a strong leg drive followed by a lean back and pull.
- For skiing, maintain a fluid motion, using your legs to drive the movement.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or even 1:30.
- Alternatively, you can substitute with a stationary bike or jump rope for a similar cardio effect.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Setup**: Stand in front of a sturdy box or platform. Ensure it’s at a height that challenges you but is safe.
- **Movement**: Step up with one foot, driving through the heel to lift your body onto the box. Bring the other foot up to meet it, then step back down one foot at a time.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
- Use your legs to power up, avoiding pushing off with your back leg.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
- You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Setup**: Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, kettlebell between your feet.
- **Movement**: Hinge at your hips and grab the kettlebell with both hands. Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up towards your chin, keeping your elbows high.

#### Form Tips:
- Maintain a flat back and engage your core during the hinge.
- Keep the kettlebell close to your body as you pull it up.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
- If kettlebells aren’t available, you can substitute with dumbbell high pulls.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Setup**: Adjust the rings to a height where you can comfortably pull yourself up. Grab the rings with an overhand grip and lean back.
- **Movement**: Pull your chest towards the rings, keeping your body straight and core engaged. Lower yourself back down with control.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your elbows close to your body as you pull.
- Avoid sagging your hips; maintain a straight line from head to heels.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows on a bar or use a TRX strap.
- Alternatively, you can do bent-over dumbbell rows.
