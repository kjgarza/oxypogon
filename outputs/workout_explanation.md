## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - For the Row: Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your arms extended, knees bent, and back straight.
    - Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - Reverse the motion: extend your arms, lean forward, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.
    - For the Ski Erg: Stand tall, grab the handles, and start with your arms extended overhead.
    - Pull the handles down towards your hips while bending your knees slightly, then return to the starting position.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your core engaged throughout the movement.
    - For rowing, focus on driving with your legs first, then pulling with your arms.
    - For the Ski Erg, maintain a neutral spine and avoid leaning too far forward or backward.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the intensity by focusing on technique rather than speed.
    - You can also switch to a stationary bike or a light jog if needed.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand facing the box with your feet hip-width apart.
    - Step up onto the box with one foot, driving through your heel to lift your body up.
    - Bring your other foot up to meet the first on top of the box, then step back down one foot at a time.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core as you step up.
    - Make sure your entire foot is on the box to avoid slipping.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
    - You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out.
    - Hold the kettlebell with both hands in front of you, arms extended.
    - Hinge at your hips and lower your body to grab the kettlebell, keeping your back straight.
    - Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up towards your chin, elbows high.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep the kettlebell close to your body as you pull it up.
    - Engage your lats and core to maintain stability.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
    - You can also perform the movement without the kettlebell to practice the motion.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them while standing.
    - Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight from head to heels.
    - Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together, then lower back down.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your body straight and avoid sagging your hips.
    - Focus on pulling with your back, not just your arms.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Adjust the height of the rings to make the movement easier or harder.
    - If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows on a barbell or use a TRX.
