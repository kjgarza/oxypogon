### Expert Explanation
Hey there, fitness friends! Today’s WOD is going to be a fun mix of strength and conditioning, so let’s break it down step by step. Grab your gear, and let’s get to it!

### Part 1: Push Jerks

**What to Do:**
- You’ll be doing **7 sets** of **2 Push Jerks** every 1:30. So, you’ll have 90 seconds to complete your two reps and then rest until the next round starts.

**How to Perform a Push Jerk:**
1. **Start Position:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, barbell resting on your shoulders (front rack position).
2. **Dip:** Bend your knees slightly and push your hips back. This is your dip position.
3. **Drive:** Explode upward by extending your knees and hips while simultaneously pressing the bar overhead.
4. **Catch:** As the bar moves up, drop under it by bending your knees and locking your arms out overhead. Your body should be in a strong, stable position with your feet under your hips.
5. **Finish:** Stand tall with the bar locked out overhead, and then lower it back to the starting position.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your core tight throughout the movement.
- Make sure your elbows are slightly in front of the bar during the dip.
- Your feet should stay flat on the ground during the dip and drive.

**Scaling Options:**
- If you’re new to the Push Jerk, you can scale down to a **Push Press** (no dip) or use a lighter weight.
- If you don’t have access to a barbell, you can use dumbbells or kettlebells.

**Building Weight:**
- Start at about **50-55%** of your one-rep max (1 RM) for the first set and gradually increase to **80-90%** by the last set. Listen to your body and adjust as needed!

### Part 2: Conditioning

Now, let’s get into the conditioning part of the WOD. This is where we’ll really get that heart rate up!

**3 Rounds of:**
1. **7 Handstand Push-Ups**
2. **7 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees**
3. **50 Lateral Dumbbell Hops**

#### Handstand Push-Ups
- **How to Do It:** Kick up into a handstand against a wall or do them freestanding if you’re comfortable. Lower your head to the ground and push back up.
- **Scaling:** If you’re not quite there yet, try **pike push-ups** or **elevated push-ups** with your feet on a box or bench.

#### Lateral Dumbbell Burpees
- **How to Do It:** Drop down into a burpee, chest to the ground, then jump up and laterally hop over the dumbbell.
- **Scaling:** If the burpee is too challenging, you can step back instead of jumping or do a **dumbbell step-over** instead of a hop.

#### Lateral Dumbbell Hops
- **How to Do It:** Stand next to your dumbbell and hop laterally over it, landing softly and maintaining balance.
- **Scaling:** If jumping is tough, you can step side to side instead.

**Repeat this sequence for 3 rounds.**

### Then, we’ll do a little extra work:

**3 Rounds of:**
1. **5 Handstand Push-Ups**
2. **5 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees**
3. **50 Lateral Dumbbell Hops**

**And finally:**
**3 Rounds of:**
1. **3 Handstand Push-Ups**
2. **3 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees**
3. **50 Lateral Dumbbell Hops**

### Finisher: Sweat

For a little extra burn, you can finish off with a **Z-Press** or **Pike Push-Up**. This is a great way to work on shoulder stability and strength.

**Z-Press:** Sit on the ground with your legs straight out in front of you and press the dumbbells overhead.
**Pike Push-Up:** Get into a downward dog position and lower your head towards the ground, then push back up.

### Wrap-Up

And there you have it! This WOD is a fantastic way to build strength and endurance.
