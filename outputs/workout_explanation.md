### Expert Explanation
## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality movement and endurance. We’re going to tackle 6 rounds of rowing or skiing, followed by some box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement while building muscular endurance and cardiovascular capacity. Remember, it’s not about how fast you go, but how well you perform each exercise!

## Workout Components Breakdown

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Rowing**: Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent, back straight, and arms extended.
  - **Drive**: Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest.
  - **Recovery**: Extend your arms, lean forward, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.
  
- **Ski Erg**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grab the handles, and keep your core tight.
  - **Pull**: Engage your core and pull the handles down towards your hips while bending your knees slightly.
  - **Return**: Let the handles rise back up, maintaining control.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.
- Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If you're new to rowing, consider reducing the time to 2:00 or using a lower resistance setting.
- For the Ski Erg, reduce the intensity or use a lighter resistance.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- Stand facing the box with feet hip-width apart.
- Step up with one foot, driving through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
- Bring your other foot up to meet the first, then step back down one foot at a time.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your chest up and engage your core throughout the movement.
- Ensure your entire foot is on the box to avoid slipping.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
- You can also perform step-ups without weights to focus on form.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out, with the kettlebell on the floor between your feet.
- Hinge at the hips and grab the kettlebell with both hands.
- Drive through your heels, extending your hips and knees, and pull the kettlebell up to your chin, keeping your elbows high.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep the kettlebell close to your body throughout the movement.
- Engage your lats and core to stabilize your back.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to the movement.
- If kettlebells are unavailable, you can substitute with dumbbells.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them while standing.
- Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight from head to heels.
- Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together, then lower back down.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your body straight and avoid sagging your hips.
- Engage your core to maintain a solid plank position.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If ring rows are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows using a barbell or TRX straps.
- Alternatively, do bent-over dumbbell rows for a similar effect.

### Strategy Advice:
- Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the workout. It’s better to break up your sets into manageable chunks rather than going all out and burning out early.
- Pay attention to your form, especially as you start to fatigue. Quality over quantity is key!
- Hydrate and take short breaks as needed, but keep moving to maintain your heart rate.

Alright team, let’s get after it! Remember to listen to your body, focus on your form, and most importantly, have fun!
