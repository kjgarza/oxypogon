### Expert Explanation
Hey there, CrossFit fam! Today’s WOD is a fun mix of strength and conditioning that’s going to challenge you, but don’t worry—I’m here to guide you through it step by step. Let’s break it down!

### Part 1: Push Jerks

**What to Do:**
- You’ll be doing 2 Push Jerks every 1:30 for a total of 7 rounds. 

**How to Perform a Push Jerk:**
1. **Setup:** Start with your feet shoulder-width apart, barbell resting on your shoulders (front rack position). Your elbows should be slightly in front of the bar.
2. **Dip:** Bend your knees slightly and push your hips back. This is a quick dip, not a squat!
3. **Drive:** Explode upward by pushing through your heels and extending your hips and knees.
4. **Catch:** As the bar rises, drop under it by bending your knees and locking your arms overhead. Your body should be in a straight line from your wrists to your heels.
5. **Stand:** Finish by standing tall with the bar locked out overhead.

**Form Tips:**
- Keep your core tight throughout the movement.
- Make sure your elbows are high in the front rack position.
- Your feet should be flat on the ground during the dip and drive.

**Scaling Options:**
- If you’re new to the Push Jerk, you can scale down to a **Push Press** (no dip) or even use a lighter weight.
- If you’re still working on your overhead strength, consider using dumbbells or kettlebells instead.

**Building Weight:**
- Start at 50-55% of your one-rep max (1 RM) and gradually increase to 80-90% as you feel comfortable. Listen to your body!

### Part 2: Conditioning

This part is where the fun really kicks in! You’ll be doing a series of rounds with a mix of Handstand Push-Ups, Lateral Dumbbell Burpees, and Lateral Dumbbell Hops. 

**3 Rounds of:**
- **7 Handstand Push-Ups**
- **7 Lateral Dumbbell Burpees**
- **50 Lateral Dumbbell Hops**

**Handstand Push-Ups:**
- Kick up into a handstand against a wall or use a box for an elevated version.
- Lower your head to the ground and push back up, keeping your core engaged.

**Scaling Options:**
- If you can’t do Handstand Push-Ups yet, try **Pike Push-Ups** or **Regular Push-Ups** instead.

**Lateral Dumbbell Burpees:**
1. Place a dumbbell on the ground.
2. Perform a burpee by going down to the ground, chest touching, then jump back up.
3. Jump laterally over the dumbbell to the other side and repeat.

**Scaling Options:**
- If burpees are tough, step back instead of jumping, or do a **Dumbbell Deadlift** instead of the burpee.

**Lateral Dumbbell Hops:**
- Stand next to the dumbbell and hop laterally over it, landing softly. Keep your knees slightly bent.

**Scaling Options:**
- If hopping is too much, you can step side to side instead.

### Sweat Option:
If you want to add a little extra, consider doing **Z-Press** or **Pike Push-Ups** as a finisher. These will help build shoulder strength and stability.

### Train vs. Compete:
- **Train:** Focus on form and technique, especially if you’re new to these movements.
- **Compete:** If you’re feeling good, push for speed and intensity!

Remember, the goal is to challenge yourself while maintaining good form. If you need to take a break or modify any movements, that’s
