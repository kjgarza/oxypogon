### Expert Explanation
## Workout Overview

Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is all about quality movement and building endurance. We’ve got a nice mix of cardio, strength, and bodyweight movements that will challenge your stamina and technique. We’ll be completing **6 rounds** of the following:

- **3:00 Row or Ski Erg**
- **20 Box Step-ups**
- **15 Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls**
- **10 Ring Rows**

The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each round while keeping a steady pace. Let’s break down each component so you know exactly what to do!

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Rowing**: Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent and back straight. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest.
- **Ski Erg**: Stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart. Grab the handles and pull them down towards your hips while engaging your core and using your legs for power.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your back straight and avoid hunching over.
- Use your legs to drive the movement; your arms should follow.
- Maintain a steady rhythm; don’t rush!

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If you’re new to rowing, aim for a lower intensity or shorter duration (1:00-2:00).
- For Ski Erg, reduce the resistance or switch to a rowing machine if needed.

### 2. Box Step-ups (20 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- Stand facing the box with your feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
- Bring your other foot up to meet the first, then step back down one foot at a time.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your chest up and core engaged throughout the movement.
- Use your legs, not your back, to lift yourself up.
- Alternate the leading foot each round to balance the workload.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lower box if you’re not comfortable with the height.
- If you have knee issues, consider doing step-ups without weights or using a bench.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly pointed out. Place the kettlebell between your feet.
- Hinge at the hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands. Stand up, driving through your heels, and pull the kettlebell up to your chin, keeping your elbows high.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your back flat and chest up as you hinge.
- Use your legs to initiate the lift; your arms should follow.
- Control the kettlebell on the way down to avoid injury.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement.
- If kettlebells aren’t available, you can use dumbbells or perform a bodyweight squat instead.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- Set the rings to a height that allows you to lean back with your arms extended. Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight.
- Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
- Engage your core to avoid sagging your hips.
- Control the movement both up and down.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows on a bar or use a TRX strap.
- Adjust the angle of your body to make it easier or harder.

### Strategy Advice:
- Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the rounds. It’s better to go slower with good form than to rush and risk injury.
- Break up the movements if needed, especially on the kettlebell pulls and ring rows, to maintain quality.
- Stay hydrated and listen to your body; if you need to take a breather, do it!

Alright, team! Let’s get after it and have some fun while we work hard! Remember, quality over quantity today. You got this! 💪
