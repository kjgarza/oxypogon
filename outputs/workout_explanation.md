## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

#### Technique Steps:
- **Rowing**: Sit on the rower, strap your feet in, and grab the handle. Start with your knees bent, back straight, and arms extended. 
  - **Drive**: Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle to your chest.
  - **Recovery**: Extend your arms, lean forward, and bend your knees to return to the starting position.
  
- **Ski Erg**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grab the handles, and start with your arms extended overhead.
  - **Pull**: Engage your core and pull the handles down towards your hips while bending your knees slightly.
  - **Return**: Extend your arms back overhead, maintaining a strong core.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement.
- For rowing, focus on driving with your legs first, then pulling with your arms.
- For the Ski Erg, use your whole body, not just your arms.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If you’re new to rowing, reduce the time to 2:00 or use a lower resistance setting.
- For the Ski Erg, you can switch to a different cardio machine like a bike if needed.

### 2. Box Step-ups (20 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- Stand facing the box with your feet hip-width apart.
- Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box.
- Bring your other foot up to meet the first, then step back down one foot at a time.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your chest up and engage your core as you step.
- Use your legs to lift, not your back. 

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lower box or perform step-ups without weights if you’re still building strength.
- If you have knee issues, consider doing reverse lunges instead.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, kettlebell on the ground between your feet.
- Hinge at your hips to grab the kettlebell with both hands.
- Drive through your heels to stand up, pulling the kettlebell up along your body to your chin, elbows high.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your back flat and chest up during the lift.
- Ensure the kettlebell stays close to your body throughout the movement.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement or if your form is breaking down.
- If kettlebells aren’t available, you can substitute with dumbbell high pulls.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

#### Technique Steps:
- Set the rings at a height where you can comfortably reach them while standing.
- Grab the rings and lean back, keeping your body straight.
- Pull your chest towards the rings, squeezing your shoulder blades together.

#### Form Tips:
- Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
- Avoid letting your hips sag or your shoulders round forward.

#### Scaling/Modifications:
- If rings are too challenging, you can perform inverted rows on a barbell or use a TRX strap.
- If you need more assistance, you can do seated rows with a resistance band.
