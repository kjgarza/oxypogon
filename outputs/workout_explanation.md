Hey everyone! Today’s WOD is structured for quality, focusing on building endurance and strength through a series of movements that will challenge your cardiovascular system and muscular endurance. We’ll be doing 6 rounds of rowing or skiing, box step-ups, kettlebell sumo deadlift high pulls, and ring rows. The goal here is to maintain good form throughout each movement while keeping a steady pace. Let’s break it down!

## Workout Components

### 1. Row/Ski Erg (3:00)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - **Rowing:** Sit on the rower with your feet secured. Start with your knees bent and arms extended. Push through your legs, lean back slightly, and pull the handle towards your chest, keeping your elbows close.
    - **Ski Erg:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grasp the handles. Start with a slight bend in your knees, and pull the handles down towards your hips while driving your arms back and engaging your core.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back straight and core engaged.
    - Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.
    - Maintain a smooth, controlled rhythm.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If you’re new to rowing or skiing, reduce the time to 2:00 or focus on technique rather than speed.
    - Consider using a resistance band for assistance if you’re struggling with the movement.

### 2. Box Step-Ups (20 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand in front of the box with feet hip-width apart. Step up with one foot, pressing through your heel to lift your body onto the box. Bring the other foot up to meet it, then step back down one foot at a time.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your chest up and engage your core.
    - Use your legs to lift, not your back.
    - Alternate the leading foot for balanced development.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lower box if you’re new to this movement or have mobility issues.
    - If you need more challenge, hold a dumbbell in each hand.

### 3. Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift High Pulls (15 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, toes pointed slightly out. Hold the kettlebell with both hands between your legs. Hinge at the hips and lower your body, then explosively extend your hips and pull the kettlebell up to your chin, leading with your elbows.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your back flat and chest up during the hinge.
    - Ensure the kettlebell stays close to your body as you pull it up.
    - Control the descent back to the starting position.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - Use a lighter kettlebell if you’re new to this movement or focus on the deadlift portion without the high pull.
    - You can also perform this with a dumbbell if kettlebells are unavailable.

### 4. Ring Rows (10 reps)

- **Technique Steps:**
    - Set the rings at a height that allows you to pull your body up at an angle. Grab the rings with an overhand grip, lean back, and pull your chest towards the rings while keeping your body straight.

- **Form Tips:**
    - Keep your core tight and avoid sagging your hips.
    - Pull with your back and arms, not just your shoulders.
    - Control the movement on the way down.

- **Scaling/Modifications:**
    - If rings are too challenging, perform inverted rows on a bar or use a TRX strap.
    - Adjust the angle of your body to make it easier or harder.

### Strategy Advice:

- Focus on maintaining a steady pace throughout the workout. It’s better to break up the reps into manageable sets rather than going all out and burning out early.
- Pay attention to your form, especially as you get tired. Quality over quantity is key here!
- Hydrate and listen to your body. If something feels off, don’t hesitate to scale back.
