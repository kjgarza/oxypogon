Coordination and upper-body strength are both challenged as the athlete experiences and strives to maintain fundamental elements of the handstand position. Despite the challenges inherent in being inverted, the athlete remains supported by three points of contact on the floor, wall, or a combination of the two throughout the entire movement. The wall walk can be the first step in a journey toward handstand mastery or a tool for skill development in athletes of any level.",
