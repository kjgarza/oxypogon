**Date:** 13.07.2025

#### Overview:
This workout consists of two parts (A and B) performed in intervals of 15 minutes each, repeated twice. The workout includes a combination of dumbbell movements and running, as well as rope climbs. 

### Part A:
**Format:** 21-18-15-12-9-6-3  
**Movements:**  
1. **Double Dumbbell Hang Cleans**  
2. **200 Meter Run**

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Double Dumbbell Hang Cleans**
   - **Starting Position:** Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.
   - **Movement:**
     - Hinge at the hips, lowering the dumbbells to just above the knees while keeping your back straight.
     - Explode upward by extending your hips and knees, pulling the dumbbells up along your body.
     - Rotate your elbows under the dumbbells as you catch them in a front rack position.
   - **Form Tips:**
     - Keep your core engaged throughout the movement.
     - Ensure your back remains flat and your chest stays up during the hinge.
     - Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms.
   - **Scaling Options:**
     - Reduce the weight of the dumbbells if necessary.
     - Perform single dumbbell hang cleans (one dumbbell at a time).
   - **Modifications for Beginners:**
     - Substitute with kettlebell swings or dumbbell front squats to build strength and technique.

     - Maintain a steady pace, focusing on your breathing and form.
   - **Form Tips:**
     - Keep your shoulders relaxed and arms at a 90-degree angle.
     - Land softly on your feet and maintain a slight forward lean.
   - **Scaling Options:**
     - If running is not feasible, substitute with a 250-meter row or 1-minute of jumping jacks.
