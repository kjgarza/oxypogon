### Let‚Äôs Dive In!

#### Part A: Double Dumbbell Hang Cleans & 200 Meter Run

1. **Double Dumbbell Hang Cleans**  
   - **How to Do It:** Start with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Hinge at your hips and lower the dumbbells to just above your knees (this is the hang position). From here, explode upwards, shrugging your shoulders and pulling the dumbbells up to your shoulders. Catch them in a front squat position.
   - **Form Tips:** Keep your back straight and core tight. Use your legs to drive the movement, not just your arms. Make sure to keep the dumbbells close to your body throughout the lift.
   - **Scaling Options:** If you‚Äôre new to this movement, you can scale down to a single dumbbell or even perform a dumbbell clean from the ground instead of the hang position.
   - **Modifications for Beginners:** If you‚Äôre not comfortable with cleans yet, try doing dumbbell front squats or kettlebell swings instead.

2. **200 Meter Run**  
   - **How to Do It:** Just run! If you‚Äôre at the gym, you can use a treadmill or measure out a distance outside.
   - **Form Tips:** Keep your shoulders relaxed, arms at a 90-degree angle, and focus on landing softly on your feet.
   - **Scaling Options:** If running isn‚Äôt your thing, you can substitute with a 1-minute row or bike ride.
   - **Modifications for Beginners:** Walk the distance instead of running if you need to.

#### Part B: Double Dumbbell Deadlifts & Rope Climbs

1. **Double Dumbbell Deadlifts**  
   - **How to Do It:** Stand with your feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand in front of your thighs. Hinge at your hips and lower the dumbbells down to the ground while keeping your back straight. Stand back up by driving through your heels.
   - **Form Tips:** Keep your chest up and shoulders back. The dumbbells should stay close to your body as you lift.
   - **Scaling Options:** If you‚Äôre not comfortable with double dumbbells, you can use a single dumbbell or even a kettlebell.
   - **Modifications for Beginners:** You can perform bodyweight good mornings or even just practice the hinge movement without weights.

2. **Rope Climbs**  
   - **How to Do It:** If you‚Äôre comfortable with rope climbs, use your legs to assist your pull and climb up the rope. If you‚Äôre not quite there yet, don‚Äôt worry!
   - **Form Tips:** Use your feet to pinch the rope for better grip and support. Engage your core as you pull yourself up.
   - **Scaling Options:** If you can‚Äôt do a full rope climb, try negative rope climbs (starting at the top and lowering yourself down) or use a band for assistance.
   - **Modifications for Beginners:** If rope climbs are too challenging, you can substitute with 5 pull-ups or 10 ring rows.

### Final Thoughts
Remember, this workout is all about pushing yourself while maintaining good form. Listen to your body and scale as needed. Whether you‚Äôre sweating it out for fun, training hard, or competing, the goal is to keep moving and enjoy the process!
