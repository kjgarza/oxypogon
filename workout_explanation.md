### Proper Form Tips:

#### Double Dumbbell Hang Cleans:
1. **Starting Position:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.
2. **Set Up:** Hinge at the hips, keeping your back straight and chest up. The dumbbells should be just above your knees.
3. **Movement:** 
   - Explode upward by extending your hips and knees.
   - Pull the dumbbells up along your body, rotating your wrists to catch them at shoulder height.
4. **Catch Position:** Land in a quarter squat with elbows high and dumbbells resting on your shoulders.
5. **Return:** Lower the dumbbells back to the hang position while maintaining control.

#### 200 Meter Run:
- Maintain a steady pace, focusing on breathing and form.
- Keep your shoulders relaxed and arms at a 90-degree angle, driving them back and forth to assist with momentum.

#### Double Dumbbell Deadlifts:
1. **Starting Position:** Stand with feet hip-width apart, dumbbells on the ground in front of you.
2. **Set Up:** Hinge at the hips
